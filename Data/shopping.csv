0,Bazaar,"A bazaar (Persian: بازار, romanized: bâzâr; Ottoman Turkish: پازار, romanized: pazar; Uzbek: bozor; Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār) or souk (Arabic: سوق, romanized: sūq; also transliterated as souq or suq) is a marketplace consisting of multiple small stalls or shops, especially in the Middle East, the Balkans, North Africa and South Asia. However, temporary open markets elsewhere, such as in the West, might also designate themselves as bazaars. The ones in the Middle East were traditionally located in vaulted or covered streets that had doors on each end and served as a city's central marketplace. Street markets are the European and North American equivalents.
The term bazaar originates from Persian, where it referred to a town's public market district. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer collectively to the merchants, bankers and craftsmen who work in that area. The term souk comes from Arabic and refers to marketplaces in the Middle East and North Africa.
Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, the earliest evidence for the existence of bazaars or souks dates to around 3000 BCE. Cities in the ancient Middle East appear to have contained commercial districts. Later, in the historic Islamic world, bazaars typically shared in common certain institutions, such as the position of the muḥtasib, and certain architectural forms, such as roofed streets and courtyard buildings known in English as caravanserais. The exact details of their evolution and organization varied from region to region.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Western interest in oriental culture led to the publication of many books about daily life in Middle Eastern countries. Souks, bazaars and the trappings of trade feature prominently in paintings and engravings, works of fiction and travel writing.
Shopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the beating heart of West Asian and South Asian life; in the Middle East, souks tend to be found in a city's old quarter. Bazaars and souks are often important tourist attractions. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance.

Terminology by region
Bazaar
In general, a souk is synonymous with a bazaar or marketplace. The term souk is used in Arabic-speaking countries.
The origin of the word bazaar comes from New Persian bāzār, from Middle Persian wāzār, from Old Persian wāčar, from Proto-Indo-Iranian *wahā-čarana. The term spread from Persian into Arabic and ultimately throughout the Middle East.
The term bazaar is a common word in the Indian subcontinent: Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Nepali: बजार, romanized: bajār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār.

Differing meanings of ""bazaar""
In North America, the United Kingdom and some other European countries, the term charity bazaar can be used as a synonym for a ""rummage sale"" to describe charity fundraising events held by churches or other community organizations in which either donated used goods (such as books, clothes and household items) or new and handcrafted (or home-baked) goods are sold for low prices, as at a church or other organization's Christmas bazaar, for example.
Although Turkey offers many famous markets known as ""bazaars"" in English, the Turkish word ""pazar"" refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate ""çarşı"" (shopping district in a downtown or downtown itself) as ""bazaar"" when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages. For example, the Turkish name for the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is ""Kapalıçarşı"" (gated shopping area), while the Spice Bazaar is the ""Mısır Çarşısı"" (Egyptian shopping area).
In Czech, the word bazar means second-hand shop. Autobazar is a shop that purchases and sells pre-owned cars.

Variations
In Indonesian, the word pasar means ""market"". The capital of Bali province, in Indonesia, is Denpasar, which means ""north market"".

Souk
The Arabic word is a loan from Aramaic ""šūqā"" (""street, market""), itself a loanword from the Akkadian ""sūqu"" (""street""). The spelling souk entered European languages likely through French during the French occupation of the Arab countries Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the word ""souk"" mostly refers to Arabic and North African traditional markets. Other spellings of this word involving the letter ""Q"" (sooq, souq, and so'oq) were likely developed using English and thus refer to Western Asian or Arab traditional markets, as there were several British colonies there during the 19th and 20th centuries.
In Modern Standard Arabic the term al-sooq refers to markets in both the physical sense and the abstract economic sense (e.g., an Arabic-speaker would speak of the sooq in the old city as well as the sooq for oil, and would call the concept of the free market السوق الحرّ as-sūq al-ḥurr).

Variations on ""souk""
In northern Morocco, the Spanish corruption socco is often used as in the Grand Socco and Petit Socco of Tangiers.
In the Indian subcontinent the 'chowk' is often used to name a place with four-way crossroad, and comes from Sanskrit चतवार, meaning four. In Western Asia (the Middle East), this term is generally used to designate the market, but may also be used in Western cities, particularly those with a Muslim community.

In Israel, the term shuk or shuq (Hebrew: שׁוּק, romanized: šūq) shares a common Aramaic origin of the Arabic souk, and holds a prominent role in everyday life. Markets such as Mahane Yehuda in Jerusalem are often covered rows of stalls much like those seen elsewhere in the region, selling produce, spices, halvah, and even clothing.
In Malta, the terms suq and sometimes monti are used for a marketplace.
In the United States, especially in Southern California and Nevada, an indoor swap meet is a type of bazaar, i.e. a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed ""booths"" or counters for the vendors.

History
Origins in antiquity
Scholar Mohammad Gharipour has pointed out that in spite of the centrality of souks and bazaars in Middle Eastern history, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. Historical records document the concept of a bazaar existing in Iran as early as 3000 BCE, where some large cities contained districts dedicated to trade and commerce. Archeological data also suggests the existence of market districts in ancient Mesopotamia. Markets centers must have existed in Egypt to conduct international trade, but no archeological evidence for them has been found. In Achaemenid Persia (550–330 BCE), documents indicate that crafts were sold in markets close to Persepolis. A network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged. Sources from around the same era also indicate that ancient Greeks regulated trade in areas at the center of their cities around stoa buildings. The ideas of Greek city planning were spread to the Middle East during the Seleucid period, following the conquests of Alexander the Great.
The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.
Sassanid rule in Iran was an important period for the development of urbanization and commerce. In Sassanid Iran the bazaar was usually the heart of a town or city, where it spread outwards and affected the development of other neighbourhoods. The bazaar usually contained, or was adjoined by, an open-air plaza that served as a forum of socio-economic activity.
Historically, souks were also held outside cities at locations where incoming caravans stopped and merchants displayed their goods for sale. Souks were established at caravanserai, places where a caravan or caravans arrived and remained for rest and refreshments. Since this might be infrequent, souks often extended beyond buying and selling goods to include major festivals involving various cultural and social activities. Any souk may serve a social function as being a place for people to meet in, in addition to its commercial function.
In pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of bazaar existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of bazaars, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.

Islamic period
According to traditional Muslim narratives, Muhammad established a market place (sūq) in Medina shortly after arriving there during the Hijrah in 622 CE. He designated an open, unbuilt space as the market area and forbade both the construction of permanent structures and the levying of taxes in this area. Eight years later, he is said to have appointed a market inspector ('āmil 'alā l-sūq), a position that likely evolved into the later muḥtasib in Islamic cities, an official in charge of overseeing public morality and regulating weights and measures. 
Despite the importance of the bazaar to economic life and the prominence of marketplace terminology in the Quran, not much is known about the early history of bazaars and it remains a topic of ongoing research. Most of the surviving urban commercial structures in the Islamic world date from the 16th century or later, though some preserved urban caravanserais (commonly known as a funduq, khān, or wakāla) date from earlier periods. The oldest of these is the Khan al-Mirjan in Baghdad, built in 1359 as part of a larger architectural complex.

Muhammad's prohibition against constructing permanent buildings and levying taxes in the market began to be disregarded as early as the Umayyad period (7th to 8th centuries). The Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik both built structures in the market of Medina and levied taxes there, while purpose-built markets were built in early Islamic cities further abroad such as Basra in Iraq, Fustat in Egypt, and Kairouan in Tunisia. This process seems to have accelerated during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) in particular. Markets that sold the most important or expensive goods were usually located near the city's central Friday mosque. In some cities, such as Cairo and Aleppo, the main bazaar was initially focused along one important street and then progressively grew and branched off into the surrounding streets.

During the Islamic period in Iran, bazaars developed along the same lines as those of the Sassanid period. Up to the 11th century, the bazaar developed more commonly in the suburbs outside the city walls that enclosed the shahristān, the formal city. This was especially true in Central Asia, though there were exceptions in some regions where the bazaar was grouped with the citadel and the city's Friday mosque inside the city walls. After the 11th century, the growing importance of the suburbs and the commercial districts resulted in most of them being enclosed within newly expanded city walls. From the 10th century onward, the bazaar became the financial center of a city and was heavily patronized and developed by ruling elites. The grouping of a bazaar, citadel, and Friday mosque also became more common.
In the Mamluk Sultanate (13th to 16th centuries) and in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries), the construction of commercial buildings in and around the bazaar was often sponsored by sultans, ruling elites, or by members of the Ottoman royal family. The revenues generated by these buildings were typically earmarked to support the upkeep of religious complexes sponsored by these same patrons, through the legal framework of a waqf (legal endowment).

21st century
In the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be ""the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance."" Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value.
The Medina of Fez, Morocco, which includes numerous long market streets (e.g. Tala'a Kebira) and bazaar areas (e.g. Kissariat al-Kifah), was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Al-Madina Souk in Aleppo is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. It is part of the Ancient Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 in Syria. The Bazaar complex in Tabriz, Iran, was listed by UNESCO in 2010. The Bazaar of Qaisiyariye in Lar, Iran, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2007. Kemeraltı Bazaar in İzmir was placed on tentative list in 2020.

Organization and institutions
Shopping at a souk or market place is part of daily life throughout much of the Middle East. Prices are commonly set by bargaining, also known as haggling, between buyers and sellers.
Bazaars or souks are traditionally divided into specialized sections dealing in specific types of product, each usually housed in a few narrow streets and named after the product it specializes in such as the gold souk, the texitle souk, the spice souk, the leather souk, the booksellers' souk, etc. This promotes competition among sellers and helps buyers easily compare prices. Merchants specialized in each trade were also organized into guilds, which provided support to merchants but also to clients. The exact details of the organizations varied from region to region.  Each guild had rules that members were expected to follow, but they were loose enough to allow for competition. Guilds also fulfilled some functions similar to trade unions and were able to negotiate with the government on behalf of merchants or represent their interests when needed.
Though each neighbourhood within the city would have a local souk selling food and other essentials, the main bazaar was one of the central structures of a large city, selling durable goods, luxuries and providing services such as money exchange. Workshops where goods for sale are produced (in the case of a merchant selling locally-made products) are typically located away from the souk itself. 
Historically, in Islamic cities, the muḥtasib was the official in charge of regulating and policing the bazaar and other aspects of urban life. They monitored things such as weights and measures, pricing, cleanliness, noise, and traffic circulation, as well as being responsible for other issues of public morality. They also investigated complaints about cheating or the quality of goods. The equivalent official could be known by other titles in different regions, such as the kedkhoda in Istanbul or the amir-i bazariyan in Delhi. In the Maghreb (northwestern Africa), the muḥtasib also shared responsibilities with other officials such as the qadi or the hakim.

Layout and architecture
Permanent bazaars were established in urban zones, usually within the city walls and close to the heart of the city. In much of the Middle East and North Africa, the bazaar is a network of interconnected spaces, including streets and buildings, with diverse architectural forms. Its boundaries are not sharply defined and can vary according to circumstance, as the bazaar is closely integrated with its urban surroundings and with other important institutions of the city.
Although there is great variety among the bazaars of this region, there are three recurring elements, in addition to the general network of market streets. One element is the individual shops or booths that line each side of a market street. The shops are usually small spaces open to the street and occupied by merchants. They are typically equipped with large shutters which can be closed and locked when the shopkeeper is away. Another element is a more secure market area, usually centrally located and consisting of streets that were covered or roofed. This complex is variably known as a qayṣariyya, bedesten, or khān, depending on the city or historical period. It usually hosted the most prestigious and profitable trades such as jewelry, perfumes, and textiles. In order to protect these goods, the entrances to this area could be closed and locked at night or in times of danger. The other recurring element is the presence of courtyard buildings entered via a single large doorway. Often translated into English as a caravanserai, this type of building is known in different regions as a funduq, khān, samsara, or wakāla. They could serve a variety of functions including an inn for travelers and merchants, a manufacturing center, a trade venue, or a warehouse.

In Iran and Central Asia, the permanent bazaar is likewise in the centre of a city and had common architectural elements. These bazaars acted as financial centers of the city and were traditionally overseen by the state. Some Iranian bazaars are organized around one long market street from which other market streets branch off (e.g. in Isfahan or Tehran), while others are large rectangular zones with a grid-like network of parallel and intersecting streets (e.g. as in Tabriz). The streets are lined with structures of one or two storeys that contain spaces for shops. The streets are typically roofed with brick vaults, pierced by skylights to allow for light and air circulation. The shops are often adjacent or connected to the workshops where the goods are also produced, so that manufacturing and retail are often concentrated in the same areas, though some production (especially of textiles) was also distributed in other parts of the city. Like the bazaars further west, there were also many khāns (caravanserais) built in the area. They acted as warehouses, production centers, wholesale centers, hostels for merchants, and offices for conducting business. 

In the cities that developed under the Ottoman Empire, there was generally one central bazaar area, known in Turkish as the çarşı. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, known locally as the Kapalıçarşı ('covered market'), is a famous example. Additionally, several types of market structures were common: the bedesten, the arasta, and the han (Turkish cognate of khān). The Ottoman bedesten was a solid stone building, typically rectangular and roofed by domes, with shops inside. Like the qayṣariyya or bedesten in other regions, it hosted the most important and luxurious trades. The arasta is usually an elongated market structure or market street with shops lining its façades. Arastas could be independent markets built outside the main bazaar area, such as those built as part of large religious complexes like the Selimiye Mosque complex in Edirne or the Sultanahmet Mosque complex in Istanbul. The Spice Bazaar or Mısır Çarşısı ('Egyptian Market') in Istanbul is also one of the largest and best-known examples. The han is similar in function to other khān or caravanserai buildings elsewhere, with a courtyard enclosed by two storeys. The ground floor was usually used for storage and for stabling horses, while the upper floor housed merchants.

Temporary souks
A temporary, seasonal souk is held at a set time that might be yearly, monthly or weekly. The oldest souks were set up annually, and were typically general festivals held outside cities. For example, Souk Ukadh was held yearly in pre-Islamic times in an area between Mecca and Ta’if during the sacred month of Dhu al-Qi'dah.  While a busy market, it was more famous for its poetry competitions, judged by prominent poets such as Al-Khansa and Al-Nabigha. An example of an Islamic annual souk is Al Mirbid just outside Basra, also famed for its poetry competitions in addition to its storytelling activities. Temporary souks tended to become known for specific types of produce. For example, Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. Political, economic and social changes have left only the small seasonal souks outside villages and small towns, primarily selling livestock and agricultural products.
Weekly markets have continued to function throughout the Arab world. Most of them are named from the day of the week on which they are held. They usually have open spaces specifically designated for their use inside cities. Examples of surviving markets are the Wednesday Market in Amman that specializes in the sale of used products, the Ghazl market held every Friday in Baghdad specializing in pets; the Fina’ Market in Marrakech offers performance acts such as singing, music, acrobats and circus activities.
In tribal areas, where seasonal souks operated, neutrality from tribal conflicts was usually declared for the period of operation of a souk to permit the unhampered exchange of surplus goods. Some of the seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.

In art and literature – Orientalism
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the Orient. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilization; the peoples could be threatening- they were ""despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational."" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.

Subject-matter
Many of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade. Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks. For example, Charles D'Oyly, who was born in India, published the Antiquities of Dacca featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. European society generally frowned on nude painting – but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.

Notable Orientalist artists
Notable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830-1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-Étienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India. Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830–1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853–1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.

Orientalist literature
A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.
Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of The Arabian Nights (translated into English from the French in 1705–08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's Oriental Tales, is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.
Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle's Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas published in 1922

1,Window shopping,"Window shopping, sometimes called browsing, refers to an activity in which a consumer browses through or examines a store's merchandise as a form of leisure or external search behaviour without a current intent to buy. Depending on the individual, window shopping can be a pastime or be used to obtain information about a product's development, brand differences, or sale prices.
The development of window shopping, as a form of recreation, is strongly associated with the rise of the middle classes in 17th and 18th century Europe. Glazing was a central feature of the grand shopping arcades that spread across Europe, from the late 18th century. Promenading in these arcades became a popular 19th-century pastime for the emerging middle classes.
Traditionally, window shopping involves visiting a brick-and-mortar store to examine the goods on display, but it is also done online in recent times due to the availability of the internet and e-commerce. A person who engages in window shopping is known as a window shopper.

History
The development of window shopping, as a form of recreation, is strongly associated with the rise of the middle classes in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeoisie stimulated demand for luxury goods, and the act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pastime or form of entertainment. Shopping for pleasure became a particularly important activity for middle and upper-class women, since it allowed them to enter the public sphere without the need for a chaperone.
Prior to the 17th century, glazed shop windows were virtually unknown. Instead, early shopkeepers typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard. Scholars have suggested that the medieval shopper's experience was very different. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers. Glazed windows, which were rare in medieval times, meant that shop interiors were dark places which militated against detailed examination of the merchandise. Shoppers, who rarely entered the shop, had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to purchase.
Glazing was widely used from the early 18th century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed. Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted, ""Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now."" The widespread availability of plate glass in the 18th century led shop owners to build windows that spanned the full lengths of their shops for the display of merchandise to draw in customers. One of the first Londoners to experiment with this new glazing in a retail context was the tailor Francis Place at his Charing Cross establishment.

In Paris, where pedestrian pavements were few, retailers were eager to attract window shoppers by providing a safe shopping environment away from the filthy and noisy streets, and began to construct rudimentary arcades, which eventually evolved into the grand arcades of the late 18th century and which dominated retail throughout the 19th century. Opening in 1771, the Colisée, situated on the Champs Elysées, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. Parisians saw this location as too remote, and the arcade closed within two years of opening. However, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked to the ends of the Palais-Royal (pictured), opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life. Within a decade, the Palais shopping complex added many more shops, as well as cafés and theatres. In its heyday, the Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the old palace grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks, as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite.
Inspired by the success of the Palais-Royal, retailers across Europe erected grand shopping arcades and largely followed the Parisian model which included extensive use of pane glass. Not only were the shopfronts made of pane glass, but a characteristic feature of the modern shopping arcade was the use of glass in an atrium-styled roofline, which allowed for natural light and reduced the need for candles or electric lighting. Modern grand arcades opened across Europe and in the Antipodes. The Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799; London's Piccadilly Arcade (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878). London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue designed to attract the elite, from the outset. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcades with expansive glazed shop-windows appeared in Paris. These were among the first modern shops to make use of glazed windows to display merchandise. Other notable nineteenth-century grand arcades included the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, first opened in 1877.
Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes. Designed to attract the genteel middle class, these shopping arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Individual stores fitted with long glass exterior windows allowed the emerging middle classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices of the luxury outlets inside the arcade.

By the 1900s the popularity of window displays had heightened and the window display became more elaborate, continuing to attract not only those that wanted to make purchases but also passers-by that appreciated beauty. To achieve the right aesthetics, store owners and managers would hire decorators or window dressers to attractively arrange merchandise in the shop windows; indeed, the professional window display design soon became an object used to lure shoppers into the stores.

As a form of leisure
Most men mistakenly assume that you look into show windows to find something to buy. Women know better. They enjoy window-shopping for its own sake. Store windows, when you look into them with pleasure-seeking eyes, are strange places full of mental adventure. They contain first clues to dozens of treasure hunts which if you follow them, lead to as many different varieties of treasure. – MW Marston, The Rotarian, September 1938
Window shopping was synonymous with being in the city and moreover offered women a legitimate reason to be able to move around in public without a chaperone. In the late 1800s it was a minor scandal to move around in public without a male chaperone because not everyone was happy about the intrusion of women into urban life. Many looked down on females who walked the streets alone and even newspaper columnists condemned their shopping habits as ""salacious acts of public consumerism."" However, the rise of window displays soon gave women a foothold in the modern city, and for many, a new pastime. Soon, housewives started roaming the city under the pretext of shopping. ""Shopping"" in this context did not always involve an actual purchase, it was more about the pleasures of perusing, taking in the sights, the displays, and the people.
Prior to the introduction of plate glass for shops and the development of window shopping, people could not just enter shops without the intention to make a purchase; even less so to walk around just for fun or to pass time. Most stores before and during World War II were small, with not enough space for people to just go and linger about. The early department stores pioneered the transformation of traditional customers into modern consumers and of mere ""merchandise"" into spectacular ""commodity signs"" or ""symbolic goods"". Thus they laid the cornerstones of a culture we still inhabit. Peoples' patronage of stores transformed from just walking in, buying and leaving to ""shopping"", especially for females. Shopping no longer consisted of haggling with the seller but of the ability to dream with one's eyes open, to gaze at commodities and enjoy their sensory spectacle.
With the development of large out-of-town malls, especially after WWII, and more recently sales outlets in central high streets, shopping places are becoming hybrid spaces mixing goods and leisure in varied proportions. Traditional small forms of stores and retail distributors have been replaced with large malls and shopping centres which now characterize contemporary Western retail. In these modern times, though malls and shopping centres have fixed prices, one can enter and leave as one wants without purchasing any item. It has become a place of socialization or leisure for most people, especially women. 

Indeed, the pleasures, meanings and competences which consumers put to work in shopping centres and department stores are far broader than their ability to bargain on price and purchase objects: in these spaces people do not just buy things, they keep up with the world of things, spending time with friends in a polished environment filled with both fantasy and information. In fact, around a third of those who enter a shopping centre leave without having bought anything. In practice, thus, window shopping is an assorted activity, done differently according to the shopper's social identity.

Online window shopping
There are some types of consumers who spend a lot of time in online marketplaces but never purchase anything or even have the intention to buy and since there are no ""transportation costs"" required on visiting an online store site, it is much easier than visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This cluster of online consumers are called ""e-window shoppers"", as they are predominantly driven by stimulation and are only motivated to surf the internet by visiting interesting shopping websites. These e-shoppers appear as curious shoppers that are only interested in seeing what is out there rather than trying to negotiate to obtain the lowest possible price. These online window shoppers use news and pictures of products to seek hedonic experience as well as keep themselves up to date with the industry status and new trends.

2,Retail therapy,"Retail therapy or shopping therapy is shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood or disposition. It occurs either due to people taking pleasure in shopping or during periods of depression or stress. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as ""comfort buys"" (compare comfort food).
The name retail therapy is ironic and semifacetious, acknowledging that shopping hardly qualifies as true therapy in the medical or psychotherapeutic sense. It was first used in the 1980s, with the first reference being this sentence in the Chicago Tribune of Christmas Eve 1986: ""We've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy.""
The fact that shopping may provide a short time of comfort (relief from dysphoria), but also imposes costs and is subject to comedown and withdrawal, make it, like opioid use, either a therapy or an addiction, depending on whether each person uses it adaptively or maladaptively. Retail therapy thus exists on a spectrum with shopping addiction (compulsive buying disorder). In 2001, the European Union conducted a study finding that 33% of shoppers surveyed had ""high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption"". This habit was causing debt problems for many. The same study also found that young Scottish people had the highest susceptibility to binge purchasing. A 2013 survey of 1000 American adults found that slightly more than half had engaged in retail therapy, with the practice being more common among women (63.9% of women and 39.8% of men); women were most likely to buy clothing while men were most likely to buy food. Research from professors at Youngstown State University found similar results (64% of women vs. 40% of men), with relief from anxiety being the most common reason for retail therapy.
Researchers at Melbourne University have advocated its classification as a psychological disorder called oniomania or compulsive shopping disorder.
Window shopping can offer some of the comforts of shopping. The advantage is that many items and many stores can be enjoyed without cost –  far more than spending would allow. The disadvantage is that one cannot acquire or keep the items.

3,Shopping,"Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers, that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a  leisure activity.
Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of traveling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.

History
Antiquity
In antiquity, marketplaces and fairs were established to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns. However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful inspection of goods prior to purchase. In ancient Greece, the agora served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods.
Ancient Rome utilized a similar marketplace known as the forum. Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100-110CE,  was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with tabernae that served as retail shops, situated on four levels.  The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront.  In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Those who lived on the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating their need to attend local markets.
Shopping lists are known to have been used by Romans. One such list was discovered near Hadrian's wall dated back to 75–125 CE and written for a soldier.

Middle Ages
Archaeological evidence suggests that the British engaged in minimal shopping in the early Middle Ages. Instead, they provided for their basic needs through subsistence farming practices and a system of localised personal exchanges. However, by the late Middle Ages, consumers turned to markets for the purchase of fresh produce, meat and fish and the periodic fairs where non-perishables and luxury goods could be obtained. Women were responsible for everyday household purchases, but most of their purchasing was of a mundane nature. For the main part, shopping was seen as a chore rather than a pleasure.
Relatively few permanent shops were to be found outside the most populous cities. Instead customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. Itinerant vendors such as costermongers, hucksters and peddlers operated alongside markets, providing the convenience of home delivery to households, and especially to geographically isolated communities.
In the more populous European cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Specialist retailers such as mercers and haberdashers were known to exist in London, while grocers sold ""miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines."" However, these shops were primitive. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than ""rude booths.""
The Medieval shopper's experience was very different from that of the contemporary shopper. Interiors were dark and shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Glazed windows in retail environments, were virtually unknown during the medieval period. Goods were rarely out on display; instead retailers kept the merchandise at the rear of the store and would only bring out items on request. The service counter was virtually unknown and instead, many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.
In Britain, medieval attitudes to retailing and shopping were negative. Retailers were no better than hucksters, because they simply resold goods, by buying cheaper and selling dearer, without adding value of national accounts. Added to this were concerns about the self-interest of retailers and some of their more unethical practices. Attitudes to spending on luxury goods also attracted criticism, since it involved importing goods which did little to stimulate national accounts, and interfered with the growth of worthy local manufacturers.

Shopping for pleasure
The modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeoisie stimulated demand for luxury goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: Indian cotton and calico; silk, tea and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World. The act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.
By the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; which changed the consumer's shopping experience. The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.

Much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying conspicuous consumption and private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of Bernard Mandeville's influential work Fable of the Bees in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.
These trends gathered momentum in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The pottery inventor and entrepreneur, Josiah Wedgewood, pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes. One of his preferred sales techniques was to stage expansive showcases of wares in this private residences or in a rented hall, to which he invited the upper classes.
As the 18th-century progressed, a wide variety of goods and manufactures were steadily made available for the urban middle and upper classes. This growth in consumption led to the rise of 'shopping' - a proliferation of retail shops selling particular goods and the acceptance of shopping as a cultural activity in its own right. Specific streets and districts became devoted to retail, including the Strand and Piccadilly in London.

The rise of window shopping as a recreational activity accompanied the use of glass windows in retail shop-fronts. By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Britain, Europe and in the Antipodes in what became known as the ""arcade era."" Typically, these arcades had a roof constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Inside the arcade, individual stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices.
Designed to attract the genteel middle class, retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos of daily street life; a place shoppers could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid nineteenth century, promenading in these arcades became a popular pass-time for the emerging middle classes.
In Europe, the Palais-Royal, which opened in 1784, became one of the earliest examples of the new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.  In London, one of the first to use display windows in shops was retailer, Francis Place, who experimented with this new retailing method at his tailoring establishment in Charing Cross, where he fitted the shop-front with large plate glass windows. Although this was condemned by many, he defended his practice in his memoirs, claiming that he:

sold from the window more goods...than paid journeymen's wages and the expenses of housekeeping.
Retailers designed attractive shop fronts to entice patronage, using bright lights, advertisements and attractively arranged goods. The goods on offer were in a constant state of change, due to the frenetic change in fashions. A foreign visitor commented that London was ""a world of gold and silver plate, then pearls and gems shedding their dazzling lustre, home manufactures of the most exquisite taste, an ocean of rings, watches, chains, bracelets, perfumes, ready-dresses, ribbons, lace, bonnets, and fruits from all the zones of the habitable world"".

Evolution of stores: from arcades to department stores
In the second half of the 19th-century, shops transitioned from 'single-function' shops selling one type of good, to the department store where a large variety of goods were sold. As economic growth, fueled by the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th-century, steadily expanded, the affluent bourgeois middle-class grew in size and wealth. This urbanized social group was the catalyst for the emergence of the retail revolution of the period.
The term, ""department store"" originated in the United States. In 19th century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. A number of major department stores opened across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid nineteenth century including; Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon Marché of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905.
The first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell & Co, which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London. This venture was described as being a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. Department stores were established on a large scale from the 1840s and 50s, in France, the United Kingdom and the US. French retailer, Le Bon Marche, is an example of a department store that has survived into current times  Originally founded in 1838 as a lace and haberdashery store, it was revamped mid-century and opened as a department store in 1852.
Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.

Shopping venues
Shopping hubs
A larger commercial zone can be found in many cities, more formally called a central business district, but more commonly called ""downtown"" in the United States, or the ""high street"" in Britain, and souks in Arabic speaking areas. 
Shopping hubs, or shopping centers, are collections of stores; that is a grouping of several businesses in a compact geographic area. It consists of a collection of retail, entertainment and service stores designed to serve products and services to the surrounding region.
Typical examples include shopping malls, town squares, flea markets and bazaars.
Traditionally, shopping hubs were called bazaars or marketplaces; an assortment of stalls lining streets selling a large variety of goods.
The modern shopping centre is now different from its antecedents, the stores are commonly in individual buildings or compressed into one large structure (usually called Mall in the USA).
The first modern shopping mall in the US was The Country Club Plaza in Kansas City which opened in 1922, from there the first enclosed mall was designed by Victor Gruen and opened in 1956 as Southdale Centre in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.
Malls peaked in America in the 1980s-1990s when many larger malls (more than 37,000 sq m in size) were built, attracting consumers from within a 32 km radius with their luxurious department stores.
Different types of malls can be found around the world. Superregional malls are very large malls that contain at least five department stores and 300 shops. This type of mall attracts consumers from a broad radius (up to a 160-km). A regional mall can contain at least two department stores or ""anchor stores"". One of the biggest malls in the world is the one near Miami, called ""Sawgrass Mills Mall"": it has 2,370,610 square feet (220,237 m2) of retail selling space, with over 329 retail outlets and name brand discounters.
The smaller malls are often called open-air strip centres or mini-marts and are typically attached to a grocery store or supermarket.
The smaller malls are less likely to include the same features of a large mall such as an indoor concourse, but are beginning to evolve to become enclosed to comply with all weather and customer preferences.

Stores
Stores are divided into multiple categories of stores which sell a selected set of goods or services. Usually they are tiered by target demographics based on the disposable income of the shopper. They can be tiered from cheap to pricey.
Some shops sell secondhand goods. Often the public can also sell goods to such shops. In other cases, especially in the case of a nonprofit shop, the public donates goods to these shops, commonly known as thrift stores in the United States, charity shops in the United Kingdom, or op shops in Australia and New Zealand. In give-away shops goods can be taken for free. In antique shops, the public can find goods that are older and harder to find. Sometimes people are broke and borrow money from a pawn shop using an item of value as collateral. College students are known to resell books back through college textbook bookstores. Old used items are often distributed through surplus stores.
Various types of retail stores that specialize in the selling of goods related to a theme include bookstores, boutiques, candy shops, liquor stores, gift shops, hardware stores, hobby stores, pet stores, pharmacies, sex shops and supermarkets.
Other stores such as big-box stores, hypermarkets, convenience stores, department stores, general stores, dollar stores sell a wider variety of products not horizontally related to each other.

Home shopping
Home mail delivery systems and modern technology (such as television, telephones, and the Internet), in combination with 
electronic commerce, allow consumers to shop from home. There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping. Online shopping has completely redefined the way people make their buying decisions; the Internet provides access to a lot of information about a particular product, which can be looked at, evaluated, and comparison-priced at any given time. Online shopping allows the buyer to save the time and expense, which would have been spent traveling to the store or mall. According to technology and research firm Forrester, mobile purchases or mcommerce will account for 49% of ecommerce, or $252 billion in sales, by 2020

Neighborhood shopping
Convenience stores are common in North America, and are often called ""bodegas"" in Spanish-speaking communities or ""dépanneurs"" in French-speaking ones. Sometimes peddlers and ice cream trucks pass through neighborhoods offering goods and services. Also, garage sales are a common form of second hand resale.
Neighbourhood shopping areas and retailers give value to a community by providing various social and community services (like a library), and a social place to meet. Neighbourhood retailing differs from other types of retailers such as destination retailers because of the difference in offered products and services, location and popularity. Neighbourhood retailers include stores such as; Food shops/marts, dairies, Pharmacies, Dry cleaners, Hairdressers/barbers, Bottle shops, Cafés and take-away shops . Destination retailers include stores such as; Gift shops, Antique shops, Pet groomers, Engravers, Tattoo parlour, Bicycle shops, Herbal dispensary clinics, Art galleries, Office Supplies and framers.  The neighbourhood retailers sell essential goods and services to the residential area they are located in. There can be many groups of neighbourhood retailers in different areas of a region or city, but destination retailers are often part of shopping malls where the numbers of consumers is higher than that of a neighbourhood retail area. The destination retailers are becoming more prevalent as they can provide a community with more than the essentials, they offer an experience, and a wider scope of goods and services.

Party shopping
The party plan is a method of marketing products by hosting a social event, using the event to display and demonstrate the product or products to those gathered, and then to take orders for the products before the gathering ends.

Shopping activity
Shopping seasons
Shopping frenzies are periods of time where a burst of spending occurs, typically near holidays in the United States, with Christmas shopping being the biggest shopping spending season, starting as early as October and continuing until after Christmas.
Some religions regard such spending seasons as being against their faith and dismiss the practice. Many contest the over-commercialization and the response by stores that downplay the shopping season often cited in the War on Christmas.
The National Retail Federation (NRF) also highlights the importance of back-to-school shopping for retailers which comes second behind holiday shopping, when buyers often buy clothing and school supplies for their children. In 2017, Americans spent over $83 billion on back-to-school and back-to-college shopping, according to the NRF annual survey.
Seasonal shopping consists of buying the appropriate clothing for the particular season. In winter people bundle up in warm layers and coats to keep warm, while in summer people wear less clothing to stay cooler in the heat. Seasonal shopping now revolves a lot around holiday sales and buying more for less. Stores need to get rid of all of their previous seasonal clothing to make room for the new trends of the upcoming season. The end-of-season sales usually last a few weeks with prices lowering further towards the closing of the sale. During sales items can be discounted from 10% up to as much as 50%, with the biggest reduction sales occurring at the end of the season. Holiday shopping periods are extending their sales further and further with holidays such as Black Friday becoming a month-long event stretching promotions across November . These days shopping doesn't stop once the mall closes, as people have more access to stores and their sales than ever before with the help of the internet and apps. Today many people research their purchases online to find the cheapest and best deal with one third of all shopping searches on Google happen between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am. Shoppers are now spending more time consulting different sources before making a final purchasing decision. Shoppers once used an average of five sources for information before making a purchase, but numbers have risen to as high as 12 sources in 2014.

Spree shopping
Spree shopping, or ‘going on a shopping spree’, is an individual period of intense and indulgent shopping involving many purchases, which differs from both normal shopping and compulsive shopping in its scope and purpose. One study reportedly showed that the pleasure centers of the brain were stimulated during a shopping spree similarly to the stimulation experienced during sexual activity. A shopping spree may be ""especially problematic for those whose immediate release of tension is followed by subsequent feelings of guilt, sadness, anger, or despair over what turned out to be an unwanted purchase"".

Pricing and negotiation
Historically, prices were established through a system of barter or negotiation. The first retailer to adopt fixed prices is thought to be the retailers operating out of the Palais-Royal complex in the 18th-century. These retailers adopted a system of high price maintenance in order to cultivate images of luxury. For their upper class clientele, fixed prices spared them from hassle of bartering.
The pricing technique used by most retailers is cost-plus pricing. This involves adding a markup amount (or percentage) to the retailers' cost. Another common technique is manufacturers suggested list pricing. This simply involves charging the amount suggested by the manufacturer and usually printed on the product by the manufacturer.
In retail settings, psychological pricing or odd-number pricing are both widely used. Psychological pricing which refers to a range of tactics, designed to have a positive psychological impact. For example, price tags using the terminal digit ""9"" (e.g., 9.99, 19.99, or 199.99) can be used to signal price points and bring an item in at just under the consumer's reservation price. However, in Chinese societies, prices are generally either a round number or sometimes some lucky number. This creates price points.
In a fixed-price system, consumers may still use bargaining or haggling; a negotiation about the price. Economists see this as determining how the transaction's total economic surplus will be divided between consumers and producers. Neither party has a clear advantage because the threat of no sale exists, in which case the surplus would vanish for both.
When shopping online, it can be more difficult to negotiate price given that you are not directly interacting with a sales person. Some consumers use price comparison services to locate the best price and/or to make a decision about who or where to buy from to save money.

""Window shopping""
""Window shopping"" is a term referring to the browsing of goods by a consumer with or without the intent to purchase. Window shopping is often practised by a particular segment, known as  the recreation-conscious or hedonistic shopper. Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer's engagement in the purchase process, and recreational shoppers are those consumers who see the act of shopping as a form of enjoyment. Other consumers use window shopping as part of their planning activity for a later purchase.
Showrooming, the practice of examining merchandise in a traditional retail store without purchasing it, but then shopping online to find a lower price for the same item, has become an increasingly prevalent problem for traditional retailers as a result of online competitors, so much so that some have begun to take measures to combat it.

Utility cycling
In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.

4,Bazaar,"A bazaar (Persian: بازار, romanized: bâzâr; Ottoman Turkish: پازار, romanized: pazar; Uzbek: bozor; Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār) or souk (Arabic: سوق, romanized: sūq; also transliterated as souq or suq) is a marketplace consisting of multiple small stalls or shops, especially in the Middle East, the Balkans, North Africa and South Asia. However, temporary open markets elsewhere, such as in the West, might also designate themselves as bazaars. The ones in the Middle East were traditionally located in vaulted or covered streets that had doors on each end and served as a city's central marketplace. Street markets are the European and North American equivalents.
The term bazaar originates from Persian, where it referred to a town's public market district. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer collectively to the merchants, bankers and craftsmen who work in that area. The term souk comes from Arabic and refers to marketplaces in the Middle East and North Africa.
Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, the earliest evidence for the existence of bazaars or souks dates to around 3000 BCE. Cities in the ancient Middle East appear to have contained commercial districts. Later, in the historic Islamic world, bazaars typically shared in common certain institutions, such as the position of the muḥtasib, and certain architectural forms, such as roofed streets and courtyard buildings known in English as caravanserais. The exact details of their evolution and organization varied from region to region.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Western interest in oriental culture led to the publication of many books about daily life in Middle Eastern countries. Souks, bazaars and the trappings of trade feature prominently in paintings and engravings, works of fiction and travel writing.
Shopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the beating heart of West Asian and South Asian life; in the Middle East, souks tend to be found in a city's old quarter. Bazaars and souks are often important tourist attractions. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance.

Terminology by region
Bazaar
In general, a souk is synonymous with a bazaar or marketplace. The term souk is used in Arabic-speaking countries.
The origin of the word bazaar comes from New Persian bāzār, from Middle Persian wāzār, from Old Persian wāčar, from Proto-Indo-Iranian *wahā-čarana. The term spread from Persian into Arabic and ultimately throughout the Middle East.
The term bazaar is a common word in the Indian subcontinent: Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Nepali: बजार, romanized: bajār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār.

Differing meanings of ""bazaar""
In North America, the United Kingdom and some other European countries, the term charity bazaar can be used as a synonym for a ""rummage sale"" to describe charity fundraising events held by churches or other community organizations in which either donated used goods (such as books, clothes and household items) or new and handcrafted (or home-baked) goods are sold for low prices, as at a church or other organization's Christmas bazaar, for example.
Although Turkey offers many famous markets known as ""bazaars"" in English, the Turkish word ""pazar"" refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate ""çarşı"" (shopping district in a downtown or downtown itself) as ""bazaar"" when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages. For example, the Turkish name for the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is ""Kapalıçarşı"" (gated shopping area), while the Spice Bazaar is the ""Mısır Çarşısı"" (Egyptian shopping area).
In Czech, the word bazar means second-hand shop. Autobazar is a shop that purchases and sells pre-owned cars.

Variations
In Indonesian, the word pasar means ""market"". The capital of Bali province, in Indonesia, is Denpasar, which means ""north market"".

Souk
The Arabic word is a loan from Aramaic ""šūqā"" (""street, market""), itself a loanword from the Akkadian ""sūqu"" (""street""). The spelling souk entered European languages likely through French during the French occupation of the Arab countries Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the word ""souk"" mostly refers to Arabic and North African traditional markets. Other spellings of this word involving the letter ""Q"" (sooq, souq, and so'oq) were likely developed using English and thus refer to Western Asian or Arab traditional markets, as there were several British colonies there during the 19th and 20th centuries.
In Modern Standard Arabic the term al-sooq refers to markets in both the physical sense and the abstract economic sense (e.g., an Arabic-speaker would speak of the sooq in the old city as well as the sooq for oil, and would call the concept of the free market السوق الحرّ as-sūq al-ḥurr).

Variations on ""souk""
In northern Morocco, the Spanish corruption socco is often used as in the Grand Socco and Petit Socco of Tangiers.
In the Indian subcontinent the 'chowk' is often used to name a place with four-way crossroad, and comes from Sanskrit चतवार, meaning four. In Western Asia (the Middle East), this term is generally used to designate the market, but may also be used in Western cities, particularly those with a Muslim community.

In Israel, the term shuk or shuq (Hebrew: שׁוּק, romanized: šūq) shares a common Aramaic origin of the Arabic souk, and holds a prominent role in everyday life. Markets such as Mahane Yehuda in Jerusalem are often covered rows of stalls much like those seen elsewhere in the region, selling produce, spices, halvah, and even clothing.
In Malta, the terms suq and sometimes monti are used for a marketplace.
In the United States, especially in Southern California and Nevada, an indoor swap meet is a type of bazaar, i.e. a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed ""booths"" or counters for the vendors.

History
Origins in antiquity
Scholar Mohammad Gharipour has pointed out that in spite of the centrality of souks and bazaars in Middle Eastern history, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. Historical records document the concept of a bazaar existing in Iran as early as 3000 BCE, where some large cities contained districts dedicated to trade and commerce. Archeological data also suggests the existence of market districts in ancient Mesopotamia. Markets centers must have existed in Egypt to conduct international trade, but no archeological evidence for them has been found. In Achaemenid Persia (550–330 BCE), documents indicate that crafts were sold in markets close to Persepolis. A network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged. Sources from around the same era also indicate that ancient Greeks regulated trade in areas at the center of their cities around stoa buildings. The ideas of Greek city planning were spread to the Middle East during the Seleucid period, following the conquests of Alexander the Great.
The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.
Sassanid rule in Iran was an important period for the development of urbanization and commerce. In Sassanid Iran the bazaar was usually the heart of a town or city, where it spread outwards and affected the development of other neighbourhoods. The bazaar usually contained, or was adjoined by, an open-air plaza that served as a forum of socio-economic activity.
Historically, souks were also held outside cities at locations where incoming caravans stopped and merchants displayed their goods for sale. Souks were established at caravanserai, places where a caravan or caravans arrived and remained for rest and refreshments. Since this might be infrequent, souks often extended beyond buying and selling goods to include major festivals involving various cultural and social activities. Any souk may serve a social function as being a place for people to meet in, in addition to its commercial function.
In pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of bazaar existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of bazaars, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.

Islamic period
According to traditional Muslim narratives, Muhammad established a market place (sūq) in Medina shortly after arriving there during the Hijrah in 622 CE. He designated an open, unbuilt space as the market area and forbade both the construction of permanent structures and the levying of taxes in this area. Eight years later, he is said to have appointed a market inspector ('āmil 'alā l-sūq), a position that likely evolved into the later muḥtasib in Islamic cities, an official in charge of overseeing public morality and regulating weights and measures. 
Despite the importance of the bazaar to economic life and the prominence of marketplace terminology in the Quran, not much is known about the early history of bazaars and it remains a topic of ongoing research. Most of the surviving urban commercial structures in the Islamic world date from the 16th century or later, though some preserved urban caravanserais (commonly known as a funduq, khān, or wakāla) date from earlier periods. The oldest of these is the Khan al-Mirjan in Baghdad, built in 1359 as part of a larger architectural complex.

Muhammad's prohibition against constructing permanent buildings and levying taxes in the market began to be disregarded as early as the Umayyad period (7th to 8th centuries). The Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik both built structures in the market of Medina and levied taxes there, while purpose-built markets were built in early Islamic cities further abroad such as Basra in Iraq, Fustat in Egypt, and Kairouan in Tunisia. This process seems to have accelerated during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) in particular. Markets that sold the most important or expensive goods were usually located near the city's central Friday mosque. In some cities, such as Cairo and Aleppo, the main bazaar was initially focused along one important street and then progressively grew and branched off into the surrounding streets.

During the Islamic period in Iran, bazaars developed along the same lines as those of the Sassanid period. Up to the 11th century, the bazaar developed more commonly in the suburbs outside the city walls that enclosed the shahristān, the formal city. This was especially true in Central Asia, though there were exceptions in some regions where the bazaar was grouped with the citadel and the city's Friday mosque inside the city walls. After the 11th century, the growing importance of the suburbs and the commercial districts resulted in most of them being enclosed within newly expanded city walls. From the 10th century onward, the bazaar became the financial center of a city and was heavily patronized and developed by ruling elites. The grouping of a bazaar, citadel, and Friday mosque also became more common.
In the Mamluk Sultanate (13th to 16th centuries) and in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries), the construction of commercial buildings in and around the bazaar was often sponsored by sultans, ruling elites, or by members of the Ottoman royal family. The revenues generated by these buildings were typically earmarked to support the upkeep of religious complexes sponsored by these same patrons, through the legal framework of a waqf (legal endowment).

21st century
In the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be ""the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance."" Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value.
The Medina of Fez, Morocco, which includes numerous long market streets (e.g. Tala'a Kebira) and bazaar areas (e.g. Kissariat al-Kifah), was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Al-Madina Souk in Aleppo is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. It is part of the Ancient Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 in Syria. The Bazaar complex in Tabriz, Iran, was listed by UNESCO in 2010. The Bazaar of Qaisiyariye in Lar, Iran, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2007. Kemeraltı Bazaar in İzmir was placed on tentative list in 2020.

Organization and institutions
Shopping at a souk or market place is part of daily life throughout much of the Middle East. Prices are commonly set by bargaining, also known as haggling, between buyers and sellers.
Bazaars or souks are traditionally divided into specialized sections dealing in specific types of product, each usually housed in a few narrow streets and named after the product it specializes in such as the gold souk, the texitle souk, the spice souk, the leather souk, the booksellers' souk, etc. This promotes competition among sellers and helps buyers easily compare prices. Merchants specialized in each trade were also organized into guilds, which provided support to merchants but also to clients. The exact details of the organizations varied from region to region.  Each guild had rules that members were expected to follow, but they were loose enough to allow for competition. Guilds also fulfilled some functions similar to trade unions and were able to negotiate with the government on behalf of merchants or represent their interests when needed.
Though each neighbourhood within the city would have a local souk selling food and other essentials, the main bazaar was one of the central structures of a large city, selling durable goods, luxuries and providing services such as money exchange. Workshops where goods for sale are produced (in the case of a merchant selling locally-made products) are typically located away from the souk itself. 
Historically, in Islamic cities, the muḥtasib was the official in charge of regulating and policing the bazaar and other aspects of urban life. They monitored things such as weights and measures, pricing, cleanliness, noise, and traffic circulation, as well as being responsible for other issues of public morality. They also investigated complaints about cheating or the quality of goods. The equivalent official could be known by other titles in different regions, such as the kedkhoda in Istanbul or the amir-i bazariyan in Delhi. In the Maghreb (northwestern Africa), the muḥtasib also shared responsibilities with other officials such as the qadi or the hakim.

Layout and architecture
Permanent bazaars were established in urban zones, usually within the city walls and close to the heart of the city. In much of the Middle East and North Africa, the bazaar is a network of interconnected spaces, including streets and buildings, with diverse architectural forms. Its boundaries are not sharply defined and can vary according to circumstance, as the bazaar is closely integrated with its urban surroundings and with other important institutions of the city.
Although there is great variety among the bazaars of this region, there are three recurring elements, in addition to the general network of market streets. One element is the individual shops or booths that line each side of a market street. The shops are usually small spaces open to the street and occupied by merchants. They are typically equipped with large shutters which can be closed and locked when the shopkeeper is away. Another element is a more secure market area, usually centrally located and consisting of streets that were covered or roofed. This complex is variably known as a qayṣariyya, bedesten, or khān, depending on the city or historical period. It usually hosted the most prestigious and profitable trades such as jewelry, perfumes, and textiles. In order to protect these goods, the entrances to this area could be closed and locked at night or in times of danger. The other recurring element is the presence of courtyard buildings entered via a single large doorway. Often translated into English as a caravanserai, this type of building is known in different regions as a funduq, khān, samsara, or wakāla. They could serve a variety of functions including an inn for travelers and merchants, a manufacturing center, a trade venue, or a warehouse.

In Iran and Central Asia, the permanent bazaar is likewise in the centre of a city and had common architectural elements. These bazaars acted as financial centers of the city and were traditionally overseen by the state. Some Iranian bazaars are organized around one long market street from which other market streets branch off (e.g. in Isfahan or Tehran), while others are large rectangular zones with a grid-like network of parallel and intersecting streets (e.g. as in Tabriz). The streets are lined with structures of one or two storeys that contain spaces for shops. The streets are typically roofed with brick vaults, pierced by skylights to allow for light and air circulation. The shops are often adjacent or connected to the workshops where the goods are also produced, so that manufacturing and retail are often concentrated in the same areas, though some production (especially of textiles) was also distributed in other parts of the city. Like the bazaars further west, there were also many khāns (caravanserais) built in the area. They acted as warehouses, production centers, wholesale centers, hostels for merchants, and offices for conducting business. 

In the cities that developed under the Ottoman Empire, there was generally one central bazaar area, known in Turkish as the çarşı. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, known locally as the Kapalıçarşı ('covered market'), is a famous example. Additionally, several types of market structures were common: the bedesten, the arasta, and the han (Turkish cognate of khān). The Ottoman bedesten was a solid stone building, typically rectangular and roofed by domes, with shops inside. Like the qayṣariyya or bedesten in other regions, it hosted the most important and luxurious trades. The arasta is usually an elongated market structure or market street with shops lining its façades. Arastas could be independent markets built outside the main bazaar area, such as those built as part of large religious complexes like the Selimiye Mosque complex in Edirne or the Sultanahmet Mosque complex in Istanbul. The Spice Bazaar or Mısır Çarşısı ('Egyptian Market') in Istanbul is also one of the largest and best-known examples. The han is similar in function to other khān or caravanserai buildings elsewhere, with a courtyard enclosed by two storeys. The ground floor was usually used for storage and for stabling horses, while the upper floor housed merchants.

Temporary souks
A temporary, seasonal souk is held at a set time that might be yearly, monthly or weekly. The oldest souks were set up annually, and were typically general festivals held outside cities. For example, Souk Ukadh was held yearly in pre-Islamic times in an area between Mecca and Ta’if during the sacred month of Dhu al-Qi'dah.  While a busy market, it was more famous for its poetry competitions, judged by prominent poets such as Al-Khansa and Al-Nabigha. An example of an Islamic annual souk is Al Mirbid just outside Basra, also famed for its poetry competitions in addition to its storytelling activities. Temporary souks tended to become known for specific types of produce. For example, Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. Political, economic and social changes have left only the small seasonal souks outside villages and small towns, primarily selling livestock and agricultural products.
Weekly markets have continued to function throughout the Arab world. Most of them are named from the day of the week on which they are held. They usually have open spaces specifically designated for their use inside cities. Examples of surviving markets are the Wednesday Market in Amman that specializes in the sale of used products, the Ghazl market held every Friday in Baghdad specializing in pets; the Fina’ Market in Marrakech offers performance acts such as singing, music, acrobats and circus activities.
In tribal areas, where seasonal souks operated, neutrality from tribal conflicts was usually declared for the period of operation of a souk to permit the unhampered exchange of surplus goods. Some of the seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.

In art and literature – Orientalism
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the Orient. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilization; the peoples could be threatening- they were ""despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational."" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.

Subject-matter
Many of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade. Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks. For example, Charles D'Oyly, who was born in India, published the Antiquities of Dacca featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. European society generally frowned on nude painting – but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.

Notable Orientalist artists
Notable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830-1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-Étienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India. Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830–1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853–1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.

Orientalist literature
A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.
Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of The Arabian Nights (translated into English from the French in 1705–08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's Oriental Tales, is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.
Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle's Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas published in 1922

6,Compton Fashion Fair,"An indoor swap meet in the United States, especially Southern California and Nevada, is a type of bazaar, a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed booths or storefronts for the vendors.

Indoor swap meets house vendors that sell a wide variety of goods and services, especially clothing and electronics. For example, vendors in the Fantastic Indoor Swap Meet in Las Vegas sellclothing, furniture, handbags and toys,…but there’s a ton more: flowers and plants, pet supplies, leather goods, sporting equipment, perfume and cosmetics, luggage and electronics, to name just a few. There also are booths for services, including window tinting, palm reading, alterations, engraving and estate planning. The majority of items sold here are new, although antique alley does feature some vintage and second-hand goods.
It is different in format to an outdoor swap meet, the equivalent of a flea market, generally open on a limited number of days and often without fixed locations for its vendors.
Indoor swap meets are present in many working-class communities across Southern California, with a concentration in Central Los Angeles.
Indoor swap meets include the Valley Indoor Swap Meet in Panorama City and Pomona (owned by the Maceric Co.) , Anaheim Marketplace, Fantastic Indoor Swap Meet in Las Vegas, and the High Desert Indoor Swap Meet in Victorville. Longstanding indoor swap meets that are now defunct include the Pico Rivera Indoor Swap Meet and San Ysidro Indoor Swap Meet.

History
Swap meets in the U.S. long consisted of U.S.-born vendors who sold mostly secondhand goods in outdoor spaces. In the 1970s, Latino immigrants started selling cultural goods and affordable services at swap meets in Southern California and some swap meets started resembling the tianguis, open-air markets, of Mexico. At the same time, drive-in movie theaters were becoming less popular, and their owners eagerly rented them out during the day to outdoor swap meets, which proliferated. Then, mostly Korean immigrants used their connections in the growing import/export trade with Asia to establish their own swap meet stalls and stock them with new, cheap goods from Asia instead of secondhand goods. In the 1980s and 1990s as properties in South Los Angeles and parts of Central L.A. became abandoned, Korean immigrants bought them and turned them into indoor swap meets.

Connection with gangsta rap
A former Sears store in Compton turned into the Compton Fashion Fair indoor swap meet. Music stall operator Wan Joon Kim helped launch the career of various local gangsta rap artists, as did Steve Yano at the Roadium on Redondo Beach Boulevard in Torrance.

7,"Plaza México (Lynwood, California)","Plaza México is a multi-purpose retail and cultural center in Lynwood, California. It includes shopping, including individual stores and an indoor swap meet; dining; and entertainment selections and is a cultural space for the Mexican-American community. Plaza México incorporates the design and style of plazas in Mexico. The mall was developed and is currently owned by Korean investors. It hosts cultural festivals and performances, such as ""El Grito de la Independencia"" and ""Cinco de Mayo"" festivities.

Mexico-themed architecture and design
Plaza México seeks to recreate Mexican regional and national icons. The architecture is based on traditional Mexican towns and contains a variety of Mexican cultural symbols from different eras. The Korean owners hired two Mexican public relations coordinators to select the icons, cultural symbols and events that are portrayed. The coordinators also selected construction materials to build Plaza México in order to produce quality and Mexican authenticity. The architectural decorations like the plaza, kiosk, fountains and monuments are similar to those of many Mexican cities. For example, Plaza México has replicas of the Angel of Independence of México City and the kiosk of the Zócalo of San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato. The plaza was reproduced with characteristics based on the appearance of the Government Palace of Jalisco at Guadalajara. The plaza’s pavement is made of adoquín stone and the benches are made of crafted iron, like the ones found in the provinces of México. Plaza México was constructed using materials from México such as stone from Zacatecas and talavera from Puebla. The mall is physically structured with open streets and a plaza to reconstruct the environment of a traditional Mexican town.

""Angel of Independence""
The reproduction of Mexico City’s Angel of Independence, which symbolizes Mexican nationhood in Mexico, marks the major entrance to Plaza Mexico. This sculpture serves as the master symbol of Plaza Mexico representing its importance in the community. The Angel has already developed some history in Plaza Mexico becoming an important site of congregation for political rallies. For example, during the March and April 2006 student walkouts for US congressional immigration reform proposals, large groups met at the Angel before marching to Los Angeles City Hall. In addition, during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, community members and other visitors gathered in Plaza Mexico to watch the games and after a victory or tie they would congregate around the Angel of Independence.

Many of the visitors consist of immigrant clienteles, some of them are unable to travel to Mexico because they do not have the legal or economic resources. Most of the visitors are of low or middle-low income status and many some of their families are undocumented immigrants and face harsh border conditions. The Plaza also attracts other local and regional visitors. The Plaza also has an altar for the “Virgen de Guadalupe” frame and the crucified “Jesus Christ” sculpture. The altar is inside a small temple located outside by the plaza. The Plaza sells different types of souvenirs, such as rosaries, crosses, keychains and T-shirts of Virgin reproductions and Mexico flags and colors.

Festivities and cultural events
The Plaza hosts a number of Mexican festivities and cultural events, such as Mexican folk music, dances, Aztec and Mejica performances, cultural exhibits and other artistic expressions. Some of the traditional celebrations that are celebrated are “Cinco de Mayo,” “El Grito de la Independencia,” and Virgin of Guadalupe: “El dia 12 de deciembre”.

Future expansion
Plaza Mexico plans on expanding the mall to have more traditional architectural elements. A temple is planned to be built somewhere outside the plaza to reinforce the expression of Mexican nationhood. According to a Plaza representative the Plaza ‘is not Mexican if it does not have a pyramid. The Plaza also plans to build a large fountain plaza displaying maps of and the United States bounded together at the center and surrounded by Latin American national flags. The large fountain is planned to be built to express inclusion of all Latino backgrounds and not just exclusively the Mexican culture.

8,Indoor swap meet,"An indoor swap meet in the United States, especially Southern California and Nevada, is a type of bazaar, a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed booths or storefronts for the vendors.

Indoor swap meets house vendors that sell a wide variety of goods and services, especially clothing and electronics. For example, vendors in the Fantastic Indoor Swap Meet in Las Vegas sellclothing, furniture, handbags and toys,…but there’s a ton more: flowers and plants, pet supplies, leather goods, sporting equipment, perfume and cosmetics, luggage and electronics, to name just a few. There also are booths for services, including window tinting, palm reading, alterations, engraving and estate planning. The majority of items sold here are new, although antique alley does feature some vintage and second-hand goods.
It is different in format to an outdoor swap meet, the equivalent of a flea market, generally open on a limited number of days and often without fixed locations for its vendors.
Indoor swap meets are present in many working-class communities across Southern California, with a concentration in Central Los Angeles.
Indoor swap meets include the Valley Indoor Swap Meet in Panorama City and Pomona (owned by the Maceric Co.) , Anaheim Marketplace, Fantastic Indoor Swap Meet in Las Vegas, and the High Desert Indoor Swap Meet in Victorville. Longstanding indoor swap meets that are now defunct include the Pico Rivera Indoor Swap Meet and San Ysidro Indoor Swap Meet.

History
Swap meets in the U.S. long consisted of U.S.-born vendors who sold mostly secondhand goods in outdoor spaces. In the 1970s, Latino immigrants started selling cultural goods and affordable services at swap meets in Southern California and some swap meets started resembling the tianguis, open-air markets, of Mexico. At the same time, drive-in movie theaters were becoming less popular, and their owners eagerly rented them out during the day to outdoor swap meets, which proliferated. Then, mostly Korean immigrants used their connections in the growing import/export trade with Asia to establish their own swap meet stalls and stock them with new, cheap goods from Asia instead of secondhand goods. In the 1980s and 1990s as properties in South Los Angeles and parts of Central L.A. became abandoned, Korean immigrants bought them and turned them into indoor swap meets.

Connection with gangsta rap
A former Sears store in Compton turned into the Compton Fashion Fair indoor swap meet. Music stall operator Wan Joon Kim helped launch the career of various local gangsta rap artists, as did Steve Yano at the Roadium on Redondo Beach Boulevard in Torrance.

13,"Sadar Bazaar, Delhi","Sadar Bazaar is the largest wholesale cosmetics jewellery market of household items in Old Delhi, Delhi, India. 
Like other major markets of Old Delhi, this market is very crowded and buzzes with activity. Although it is primarily a wholesale market, it also caters to occasional retail buyers. Owing to the sheer volumes that are traded here every day, a visit to the market can be termed sensory overload. In addition to being a market for traders, Sadar Bazaar is a assembly constituency, making it a hub for politics. Sadar Bazar is in the list of World's 9 Most Iconic Markets, as per Times Travel. Sadar Bazar market was developed in 1830 by the British officer Charles Trevelyan. Sadar Bazar is the largest wholesale market in Asia & India. 'Bara Tooti Chowk' in Sadar Bazar, is the main intersection in the market, where all the protest, functions/celebrations, meetings, etc. are done. Daily Business worth of ₹300crore is done on daily basis in the market.

History
Paharganj, also referred as Shahganj or King's ganj or market place during Mughal era, gets its present name 'Paharganj', literally meaning Hilly neighbourhood, owing to its proximity to the Raisina Hill, where the Rashtrapati Bhavan stand today. Till, 1857, neighbourhoods like Paharganj, Kishenganj, and Pahari Dhiraj, were separate pockets which in the following years grew and merged, for example Pahari Dhiraj merged into Sadar Bazaar.

Location and transportation
Sadar Bazaar is located on the western side of Khari Baoli street. It is connected to the rest of the city via buses (closest station is Kashmere Gate ISBT), auto-rickshaws and trains (closest metro station is Tis Hazari  Metro Station).
The area also has a railway station named Delhi Sadar Bazar (Code: DSB). It is 1 km (0.62 mi) from New Delhi railway station and trains take about 9 to 15 minutes to reach there. All the trains that stop here are either EMUs, MEMUs or passenger trains consisting of General class seating arrangements. As of 2015, the rail ticket fare for this leg is ₹5.

Commodities
Sadar Bazaar consists of numerous smaller markets, including Pratap market, Swadeshi market and Teliwara or Timber market. The market, as a whole, not only deals in household goods, but also in various other items such as toys, imitation jewellery and stationery. It has become a den of counterfeit products of many multi-national companies, FMCG products and especially cosmetic goods of deceptively similar character. It was thus listed as a ""notorious market"" by the USTR in 2015 for selling counterfeit consumer goods and cosmetics.
Traders and shoppers have access to authentic Indian food, including delicacies deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter) and mithai (traditional sweets) of various kinds. The lanes are plenty and narrow, lined with shops selling imported goods, clothing, shoes and leather items, electronic and consumer goods, and more. The market, even more so than the rest of the city, is very congested.

Concerns
Considered by some to be the biggest wholesale market in Asia, accounts from local traders indicate that Sadar Bazaar suffers from over-congestion of stalls, power cuts, lack of sanitation facilities, improper maintenance of roads and frequent traffic jams.
Despite being chaotic, Sadar Bazaar remains a tourist attraction.

Swadeshi Market
Swadeshi Market in Sadar Bazaar is famous for artificial jewellery, toys, gifts item, and household plastics. Inside Sadar Bazaar, every lane is having its local association and having shops of different goods.

Administration and politics
Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association (Regd.) is the parental organisation of all the major trade associations of Sadar Bazaar.
Sadar Bazaar is part of the Sadar-Paharganj constituency, one of the twelve administrative zones of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). As of 2015, this constituency is represented by Som Dutt of the Aam Aadmi Party. Prior to Dutt, this Vidhan Sabha constituency was represented by Rajesh Jain of the Indian National Congress (INC). Previously a parliamentary constituency, it is now a part of Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency represented by Harsh Vardhan of the BJP.

14,Upal,"Upal (Chinese: 乌帕尔镇; Uyghur: ئوپال) is a town in Shufu County in Western Xinjiang, China.

Karakoram Highway

Mahmud al-Kashgari
Mahmud al-Kashgari died in 1102 at the age of 97 in Upal. There is now a mausoleum erected on his gravesite. He is remembered as a prominent Turkic language scholar.

Monday Bazaar
A bazaar (Chinese: 乌帕尔乡的周一巴扎) is held every Monday.  Being that this village is along the Karakoram Highway, it is frequently visited not only by local people but also by the tourists on their way back from Karakul Lake, a popular sightseeing site in Kashgar.

16,2016 Ludwigshafen attempted bombings,"On 16 December 2016, a bombing plot was uncovered in Ludwigshafen, Germany. The 12-year-old German-Iraqi boy, who was reported to be the perpetrator, was directed by an ISIL supporter to build two nail bombs and plant them at the local Christmas market and near a shopping centre.

Incidents
After a first attempt failed at the Christmas market on 26 November when the bomb did not explode, the boy tried a second time on 5 December near the mall and the town hall of Ludwigshafen He was reported to have been radicalised or instructed by an unidentified ISIS member. The German federal prosecutor declined to comment on the ISIS stories and announced an investigation into his motives. The device contained “pyrotechnic material” believed to have been extracted from fireworks and sparklers and tests revealed that the mix was combustible, but not explosive. The state youth welfare office took charge of the boy.

Suspect
The suspect was born in Ludwigshafen.  His name was not released because of German privacy laws; German law also does not allow criminal prosecution of those younger than 14.  The suspect had contemplated traveling to Syria in mid-2016 to join the Islamic State.

Investigation and trial
On 13 April 2018, an Islamic State supporter was sentenced in Vienna to nine years in prison for instigating the crime and for planning another attack on the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany along with a 15-year-old girl married to him under Islamic law. During the trial, the suspect of the Ludwigshafen bombing, now 14 years old, emphasized that the bombing was his own idea. The bombing only failed because the fuse cord was insufficient.

Reactions
Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for the German government, said: ""This is certainly a report that scares everyone.""
Peter Altmaier, The German minister of the chancellery, said that the authorities were ""sensitized"". They had to investigate whether the child was radicalised at home or through the internet.

17,2010 Portland car bomb plot,"The 2010 Portland car bomb plot involved an incident in which Mohamed Osman Mohamud (born 1991), a Somali-American student, was arrested in an FBI sting operation on November 26, 2010, after attempting to set off what he thought was a car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting in Portland, Oregon. He was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. An attorney for Mohamud argued that his client was entrapped. On January 31, 2013, a jury found Mohamud guilty of the single charge against him. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 18, 2013, however the sentencing was cancelled in anticipation of the filing of new motions by the defense. In September 2014, Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison with credit for time served, as well as lifetime supervision upon release in 2040.

Background and incident
Mohamud was born in Somalia, came to America as a refugee, and grew up in Beaverton, Oregon, a suburb of the Portland metropolitan area. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Mohamud graduated from Westview High School in Beaverton. He attended Oregon State University, but dropped out on October 6, 2010, without having declared a major. At the time of the incident, he was a resident of Corvallis, Oregon.
Under the pen name Ibnul Mubarak, Mohamud had written articles on physical fitness for the English-language publication Jihad Recollections as part of his earlier attempts to be associated with violent jihad ideology. He maintained contact with a former American student living in Pakistan.
Mohamud had been monitored by the FBI for months. He reportedly attracted the interest of the FBI after agents intercepted e-mails he was exchanging with a man who had returned to the Middle East, and whom law enforcement officials described as a “recruiter for terrorism.” The man had previously lived in Oregon, where Mohamud reportedly met him, before moving first to Yemen and then to Pakistan.
A year prior to his arrest, he was accused but not charged with date raping an intoxicated woman on the Oregon State University campus.
Prior to Mohamud's arrest, an undercover FBI agent, posing as a terrorist, had been in contact with him since June 2010. The FBI put him on a no-fly list, preventing him from traveling to Kodiak, Alaska from Portland International Airport on June 10, 2010. Prosecutors said he was instead interviewed by the FBI, whom he told he wanted to earn money fishing and then travel to join ""the brothers,"" and that he had earlier hoped to travel to Yemen but had not obtained a ticket or visa.

In preparation for the planned bombing of a public gathering, Mohamud and undercover FBI operatives drove to a remote area of Lincoln County, Oregon, where they conducted a test run on November 4 by detonating a real bomb Mohamud believed to have been hidden inside a backpack.
The attempted main bombing took place at Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square at the corner of Southwest Yamhill Street and Sixth Avenue, as tens of thousands of people gathered for the city's annual Christmas tree lighting.  The fake bomb was in a white van that carried six 55-gallon drums with what appeared to be real detonation cords and plastic caps. Mohamud tried to detonate the bomb by dialing a cell phone that was attached to it. When the device failed to explode, the undercover agent suggested he get out of the car to obtain better reception. When he did so he was arrested.
Because the FBI ensured that the device had no explosive components—even the detonating caps were inert—the public was never in any danger. According to an affidavit, Mohamud told the agents, ""I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured.""

Analysis
Early analysis questioned whether entrapment by FBI operatives was involved, an Oregonian columnist asking ""how far would Mohamud have traveled down that road without the help of those very operatives?"" Noting ""astonishing similarities"" to a simultaneous case near Baltimore, Maryland, The Oregonian quoted a New York University expert that such cases were ""a strategy the FBI set upon years ago."" Presumably aware of legal defenses based on issues of entrapment, FBI agents reportedly offered Mohamud multiple alternatives to a bombing with mass casualties, including prayer. Mohamud reportedly insisted he wanted to play an ""operational"" role, and even wanted to pick the target for the bombing. He had also been told several times that his planned bomb could kill women and children, and was given multiple opportunities to back out, but he told agents: ""Since I was 15 I thought about all this... It's gonna be a fireworks show... a spectacular show."" Christopher Dickey of Newsweek said the FBI ""took no chances with the court of public opinion"" to make sure that Mohamud did not appear to be a victim of entrapment. Noting that key evidence from an alleged July 30 meeting may already be missing, a court ordered the FBI to preserve remaining media and recording equipment. Noting past behavior by the FBI in similar cases, New York lawyer Martin Stolar asserted the absence of such recordings was intentional. ""Once somebody's been induced, and they agree to do the crime, that's when the recording starts.... He's already been induced to commit the crime, so everything on the tape is shit.""
A The Washington Post feature traced the radical roots of the ideology held by young Somalis such as Mohamud to the Islamicization of Somalia following the collapse of the socialist government of Mohamed Siad Barre.
Somali Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Omar said ""Mohamud's attempt is neither representative nor an example of Somalis. Somalis are peace-loving people,"" adding that the Somali government was ""ready and willing"" to assist in preventing future attempts.

Trial
Mohamud was charged with a single count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. His trial began on January 10, 2013 and concluded on January 31 with the jury finding him guilty. He faced up to life in prison and was initially scheduled to be sentenced on June 27, 2013. However, in a motion filed on June 17, federal prosecutors requested that sentencing be delayed two to three months because the government needs more time to prepare its sentencing recommendations. Mohamud's sentencing was subsequently rescheduled for December 18, 2013, then cancelled in anticipation of defense motions.  In October 2014, Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison along with credit for time served since his arrest, as well as lifetime supervision upon his scheduled release in 2036. He is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone, a low-security federal prison in Minnesota.

Mosque arson
The Salman Al-Farisi Islamic Center in Corvallis, Oregon, where Mohamud occasionally attended services, was set on fire on November 28, 2010. Police determined that arson was the cause and investigated it as a possible hate crime. In response, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on authorities to increase their presence in Muslim communities in Oregon.
On August 24, 2011, federal agents arrested Cody Seth Crawford, 24, on a federal hate crimes indictment in what they stated was a racially motivated arson at the mosque. A federal judge ordered that Crawford be detained as a danger to the community due to his prior arrest history. Crawford's court-appointed attorneys stated that he suffers from alcohol and mental illness issues.  Crawford was convicted of a federal charge of damaging religious property and sentenced to 5 years probation.

18,2016 Berlin truck attack,"On 19 December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. One of the victims was the truck's original driver, Łukasz Urban, who was found shot dead in the passenger seat. The truck was eventually stopped by its automatic brakes. The perpetrator was Anis Amri, an unsuccessful asylum seeker from Tunisia. Four days after the attack, he was killed in a shootout with police near Milan in Italy. An initial suspect was arrested and later released due to lack of evidence. Nearly five years after the attack, a man who was critically injured during the attack died from complications related to his wounds, becoming the 13th victim. As of December 2023, this attack remains the worst Islamist terrorist attack by number of casualties in German history.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack and released a video of the perpetrator, Anis Amri, pledging allegiance to the terror group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Background
The Berlin attack took place during a time of heightened Islamist terrorist activity in Europe. Several terrorist attacks in 2016, in Germany and in neighboring countries, have been linked to ISIS; some of them were similar to the truck attack on the Christmas market in Berlin (e.g. the 2014 Nantes attack and the 2016 Nice truck attack, both in France).

Attack
Truck hijacking
The vehicle involved, a black Scania R 450 semi-trailer truck, bore Polish number plates and belongs to a Polish delivery company, Usługi Transportowe (Transport Services) Ariel Żurawski, based in Sobiemyśl. The truck was on its return leg to Poland, having started its trip in Turin, Italy, and was transporting steel beams to a Berlin warehouse owned by ThyssenKrupp.

The head of the delivery company, Ariel Żurawski, reported that his cousin Łukasz Robert Urban had been driving the truck to Berlin, but that he could not imagine him being responsible for the attack. Żurawski's company last contacted Urban between 15:00 and 16:00, when Urban reported that he had arrived a day early to the Berlin warehouse and that he had to wait there overnight to unload his truck the following morning. The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00.
The family had been unable to contact Urban since 16:00. Żurawski suspected that the truck had been hijacked based on its GPS coordinates, as well as indications that the truck was being driven erratically. Żurawski later identified the victim found in the truck as his cousin Urban, the original driver of the semi-trailer; Urban was killed by the perpetrator of the attack. According to a post-mortem examination cited by the German media, Urban was shot in the head between 16:30 and 17:30.

Attack on Christmas market
On 19 December 2016, at 20:10 local time, the perpetrator drove the stolen truck through a Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz in the City West of Berlin, killing 11 people and injuring 56. The incident is the deadliest terrorist attack in Germany since an attack at Oktoberfest in Munich in 1980, which killed 13 people and injured 211 others. The truck came from the direction of Hardenbergstraße, drove about 50 metres (160 ft) through the market, and destroyed several stalls before turning back onto Budapester Straße and coming to a stop level with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.
Several witnesses saw the driver leave the truck and flee towards Tiergarten. One witness ran after him.
Łukasz Urban was found dead in the passenger seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once in the head with a small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.
The Christmas market reopened on 22 December. Damaged stalls were removed and memorials were set up in their stead. Concrete barriers were placed along sides facing streets.

Victims
Twelve people died and at least forty-eight were injured throughout the attack. Many of those injured sustained serious injuries and broken bones from either being hit by the truck, or by the collapse of the wooden stalls that were damaged by the truck. Five years after the attack, a first responder to the attack died in 2021 due to injuries he sustained while responding to victims. It is believed that he was wounded by a beam, sustaining serious head injuries.

Investigation
The police and public prosecutor investigated the incident as a terrorist attack. The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, said, ""We must assume this was a terrorist attack."" The German Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière, described the incident as a brutal attack. The U.S. Department of State had previously warned of terrorist attacks on Christmas markets in Europe after ISIL took control of Raqqa and Mosul. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after the release of a Pakistani suspect who was mistakenly detained.

Initial suspect
On the evening of 19 December, police arrested a suspect, believed to have driven the truck during the attack, near the Berlin Victory Column. He had aroused suspicion by running away from the scene of the attack out of fear that he would be considered a suspect. The arrested man, initially identified only as Naved B. (later said to be Naved Baloch by the British newspaper The Guardian), denied involvement and was later identified as a 23-year-old asylum seeker from Turbat, Pakistan. The Berlin SEK police tactical unit stormed the hangar at the former Berlin Tempelhof Airport, which is used as a refugee camp, where the arrested man lived with six others in a room. His mobile phone was seized and analyzed. Police sources later suggested that they might have arrested ""the wrong man"" because the individual in custody did not carry gunshot residue or any marks that would indicate that he had been in a fight. Furthermore, forensic tests did not indicate that the suspect was inside the cab of the truck. Police therefore believed that the attacker might still be at large.
German Public Prosecutor General Peter Frank said, ""We have to get used to the idea that the man apprehended may not be the perpetrator or belong to the group of perpetrators."" The man was released on the evening of 20 December due to lack of evidence.

In an interview with The Guardian on 29 December, he narrated the incident of his arrest on 19 December. According to him, after leaving a friend's house and crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening, a car started following him after which he walked faster. When he realised that it was a police car, he stopped when they asked him to and showed his identification documents to them. He was allowed to go, but was called back seconds later and arrested. He claimed that he was tied up, blindfolded and also slapped by the police after refusing to undress for photographs. He said in the interview that he had gone into hiding, fearing for his life. The Guardian also said he had applied for asylum in Germany as a member of a secular separatist movement in Balochistan province of Pakistan.

Anis Amri
On 21 December, police announced that investigators had found, under the truck's driver's seat, a suspension of deportation permit belonging to Anis Amri, a man who was born in Tataouine, Tunisia, on 22 December 1992. Authorities began a Europe-wide search for Amri. According to investigators, Amri entered Germany from Italy in 2015 and had contacts with the network of the recently arrested Salafist preacher Abu Walaa, a known ISIL recruiter in Germany. Amri was sought by the Federal Criminal Police Office. Officials called for a public manhunt, issuing a recent picture, and offering a reward of €100,000, warning that Amri might be armed and dangerous. He was described as being 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall, weighing approximately 75 kilograms (165 lb), with dark hair and brown eyes.
Amri fled from Tunisia to escape imprisonment for stealing a truck and arrived for the first time in Europe in 2011 on a refugee raft at the island of Lampedusa. He lied about his age, pretending to be a minor, and was sent to the temporary migrants reception center on the island. At the center, according to Italian security officials, Amri ""took part in a particularly violent riot, when the center was set on fire and several people were injured"" and was sentenced for it and robbery to four years in prison, which he served in two jails in Sicily. Amri was released in 2015; according to Italian officials, the Tunisian authorities refused to accept his repatriation to Tunisia, and it is believed that he went to Germany around this time. Per an autopsy on his body, it was found that he frequently consumed drugs.
In Tunisia, Amri was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison, ""reportedly for aggravated theft with violence"". Prior to that he had been arrested several times for possession and use of drugs. According to his family, he drank alcohol, took drugs and was initially not religious, but had been radicalized in Italian jails. The man arrived in Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April 2016. He used at least 14 different aliases and posed as a citizen of Syria, Egypt or Lebanon. He reportedly had tried to recruit participants for a terrorist attack since the spring, and once tried to buy a pistol from an undercover police officer. He had been overheard by the German intelligence offering to carry out a suicide attack, but the German authorities had decided not to arrest him because they deemed him a mere errand boy. The German CID warned in March 2016 that he was planning a suicide attack and recommended immediate deportation. However, the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia ruled he could not be deported. In Germany he was involved in a bar brawl and drug dealing; later he was involved in a knife attack over drugs in July 2016 and disappeared after police tried to question him. Three weeks before the attack, Moroccan intelligence warned Germany about the terrorist attack planned by him. He had started spending more time in Berlin before the attack and was being closely monitored, however showed no signs of planning a terrorist attack per a report submitted by the German Interior Minister to the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. German authorities were seeking to deport him at the time of the attack, however the legal requirements had not been met because Tunisia initially denied that Amri was their citizen but documents confirming it arrived in Germany after the attack.
A few minutes after the attack, a surveillance camera spotted him at Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station which is close to the Christmas market. At the station, he turned to the camera and raised a finger, a gesture commonly used by Islamists. He later left Germany, travelling to Netherlands, Belgium and France before reaching Italy. On 23 December at around 03:00 CET, Amri was killed in a shootout with police in front of the railway station in Sesto San Giovanni near Milan. He had just arrived by train from Chambéry, France (via Turin). During a routine patrol, two police officers asked to search his backpack after he said he did not have any identity documents. Amri pulled out a gun and shot one of the officers in the shoulder; the other officer shot Amri dead. The Italian Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, stated that a policeman had been hospitalized with a shoulder injury. On the same day, Amaq released a video of Amri pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIL. German officials have confirmed that Amri's fingerprints matched those in the inside of the truck.
On 28 December, German prosecutors said they had detained a 40-year-old Tunisian man, who they thought may have been involved in the attack. Amri had saved the number of this man in his phone. Prosecutors stated on the next day that he was released after investigations revealed that he was not a suspected contact of Amri. They also confirmed that the attacker had sent a mobile phone voice message and a picture to a contact shortly before carrying out the attack. The German police raided the homes of two suspected associates on 3 January 2017, including a 26-year-old Tunisian man they suspected of being in contact with Amri and knowing about the attack as well as a former flatmate of Amri. The Tunisian suspect who was suspected of either planning the attack or knowing about it was detained with federal prosecutors stating that he had known Amri since the end of 2015, had met him a day before the attack and both had ""very intense conversations"". Amri's former flatmate was also being investigated and the attacker had tried to contact him twice on 19 December.
Italian police confirmed on 4 January that the gun used in the attack, a .22-caliber Erma Model EP552S pistol (Walther PPK clone), matched the one found on Amri. ZDF reported on 6 January that he might have acquired the gun in Switzerland and lived there for a prolonged period of time whose length investigators were trying to determine. Swiss prosecutors meanwhile opened a case related to the attack. The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland later confirmed that he had spent some time in the country while the German police were investigating whether the gun was acquired by him there. Investigators stated on 18 January that the gun was imported legally into Switzerland in 1990s, but it remained unclear what happened to it afterwards as it didn't appear in the weapons registers of cantons of Switzerland and there was no national weapons register at the time.
On 24 December, Tunisian authorities arrested three men suspected of terrorist links including Amri's nephew. They stated that Amri had urged his nephew to join ISIL and had sent him money to travel to Europe. Tunisian Interior Ministry stated that he had also told him that he was the emir or leader of a German jihadist group called ""Abu al-Walaa brigade"". Another person was announced to have been arrested on 7 January in Tunisia in relation to the case. However all four were released on the next day as they weren't found to have links to the attack or any terrorist group.
Italy's Interior Ministry announced on 12 March that it had deported a 37-year-old Tunisian man whose telephone number was in Amri's contact list. The ministry stated that he had been in contact with the attacker and his number was also linked to a Facebook profile supporting jihadist ideology where he connected with supporters of ISIL. It added that he was living in Latina where he associated with fellow extremists who opposed a moderate imam at a local mosque. In late-March, Turkey arrested more than 6 men allegedly linked to Amri.

Amri's friends
Six individuals including some friends of Amri's were arrested on 8 April 2018 for planning a knife attack on a sports event in Berlin. The main suspect was under police surveillance. They were all released after no evidence was found that they were planning a terror attack.

Defective investigation and obstruction of justice
On 17 May 2017 the Interior Ministry of Berlin stated that already in November 2016 intelligence was given that Anis Amri was involved in criminal offenses concerning drug trafficking. On this basis authorities would have been able to apprehend Amri already at the time, however they did not. An investigation was launched trying to find out to what extent this information was withheld by the State Criminal Police Office of Berlin after the attack happened. Several days later, while the investigation for obstruction of justice was still going on, a speaker of the Interior Ministry said that manipulations of the file of Amri have been carried out by officers of the criminal investigation department after the attack. On 22 May 2017 a commission of inquiry was initiated starting in July. Meanwhile, a special prosecutor was appointed to the case. In addition to the ongoing investigation concerning manipulations of the file and withholding of information, national TV reported on 1 June, that officers who were ordered by an investigating judge in Berlin to observe Amri until October 2016 for criminal offenses and possible terrorist links did not do so and instead included untrue records regarding observing actions in his file.

Reactions
Many world leaders offered condolences to Germany and the victims of the attack.
National and international right-wing politicians and commentators blamed the attack partly on German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her policy of accepting an unlimited number of asylum seekers and migrants. Euroskeptic politicians also condemned the lack of border checks under the Schengen system for allowing the perpetrator to travel freely through several countries after the attack. By contrast, several other national and international political commentators praised what they described as the cool-headed reaction of the Merkel administration. The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that it was ""dangerous"" to blame German refugee policy without waiting for facts about the identity of the attacker to emerge.
A petition to award Urban the Bundesverdienstkreuz had gathered over 2,500 signatures by the afternoon of 22 December. A donation page to support his family was set up on GoFundMe and collected more than £110,000 by 23 December by British truck driver Dave Duncan. He was officially thanked by Polish Ambassador to the United Kingdom Arkady Rzegocki at a ceremony at Embassy of Poland, London on 9 January 2017. Polish authorities provided funds for the delivery of Urban to his family as well as the costs of the funeral and the family of Urban received a state pension. German authorities refused to reimburse the value of the destroyed truck which belonged to a company run by Urban's cousin.
Muslims and Christians in Berlin held a vigil in solidarity with the victims of the attack. The funeral of Urban was held on 30 December at the Polish village of Banie and was attended by hundreds of people including President of Poland Andrzej Duda.
The German government reformed its security rules in response to the attack. Among the proposals in the anti-terror plan were easing the deportations of rejected asylum seekers, increasing surveillance of those to be deported and those considered to be terror risks, limiting movement of some asylum seekers within Germany, using electronic tags on those deemed terror threats without a trial, lengthening the period suspects can be held in custody and limiting development aid to countries that don't cooperate in deportation processes. President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi meanwhile stated that Europe ""must be calm"", vowing to take responsibility for the attacks, but insisted that it was necessary to verify citizenship before accepting deportations. The Bundestag passed a new surveillance law on 9 March in response to the attack as well as other attacks that occurred in Germany in 2016. The law gives priority to public safety when deciding on whether to permit installation of video surveillance in some locations and makes it easier for private companies to install these systems in public places. It also voted for allowing the Federal Police to install surveillance systems for reading and registering licence plate numbers.

Aftermath
In February 2017, the German Salafist mosque organisation Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein was banned by authorities. Amri was said to be among its visitors. In March 2017, the German Muslim community organisation Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim was also banned after investigators found that its members were preparing to travel to the conflict zone in Syria to fight for the Islamic State. According to the Federal Agency for Civic Education, these examples show that Salafist mosques not only concern themselves with religious matters, but also prepare serious crimes and terrorist activities.
In preparation for the Christmas market 2018, the Breitscheidplatz square and its surrounding were fortified against further terrorist attacks.
On the fourth anniversary in December 2020, a ceremony, which was attended by survivors and relatives of the victims, was held at the Breitscheidplatz to commemorate those killed in the attack. The archbishop of Berlin Heiner Koch said in his prayers that Berlin ""was not the same as before"".

19,Strasbourg Cathedral bombing plot,"In December 2000, an al-Qaeda-linked plot to bomb the Strasbourg Christmas market, at the feet of the Strasbourg Cathedral, on New Year's Eve was discovered. The plot was foiled by French and German police after a terrorist network based in Frankfurt, Germany, the ""Frankfurt group"", was unravelled. A total of fourteen people were convicted as part of the plot; four in Germany and ten in France, including the operational leader, Mohammed Bensakhria (a.k.a. ""Meliani""), thought to be a European deputy to Osama bin Laden. The alleged mastermind of the plot was thought to have been Abu Doha, who was detained in the United Kingdom.

Arrests
After being tipped off by British intelligence, German police on 26 December 2000 discovered bomb-making equipment during a raid of an apartment in Frankfurt. Four men were arrested. Among the findings were several pressure cookers, 30 kg of chemicals that could be used to make explosives, and a notebook describing how to mix homemade bombs. A video was also discovered, showing a crowded Christmas market in Strasbourg, with a voiceover in Arabic calling the people in the video ""enemies of Allah."" The voiceover, attributed to one of the suspects, further said ""This cathedral is Allah's enemy,"" and ""You will go to hell, Allah willing."" The call that had alerted British intelligence had been made by one in the group asking Abu Doha, the alleged mastermind of the plot, for more cash; Doha was already wanted by the United States for his connection to the Los Angeles International Airport millennium bombing plot.
Members of the Frankfurt group were found to have trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, to have connections to Islamist networks in Spain, Italy, Belgium and the United Kingdom, and to the Algerian terrorist group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC). The discovery of the plot in Frankfurt led to further arrests in the United Kingdom, where another plot of killing members of the European Parliament was discovered, in which MEPs were to be killed with sarin nerve gas during session in Strasbourg in February 2001. British police arrested twelve people including Doha in February 2001 as a result of the Frankfurt operation. All British suspects were quickly released due to ""lack of evidence,"" although Doha was subsequently re-arrested. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the charges against six main suspects were dropped for ""security reasons,"" which was linked by others to an MI5 bid to ""monitor"" the group.

Trials and convictions
In March 2003, the four suspects in Frankfurt, Aeurobui Beandali, Salim Boukhari, Fouhad Sabour and Lamine Maroni were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years' imprisonment. According to the Frankfurt court, the group had planned to blow up pressure cookers packed with explosives, as they had learned in training camps in Afghanistan. The target was reported to have been the Christmas market at the Strasbourg Cathedral on New Year's Eve. The target was said to have been chosen deliberately for its Christian symbolism. Beandali was the only to confess to the plot, while Boukhari and Sabour claimed to have planned to attack an empty synagogue in Strasbourg.
In December 2004, ten suspects were put on trial in Paris, accused of being members of the Frankfurt group. The suspects, all Algerian or French-Algerian, were sentenced to terms of up to 10 years, convicted for ""criminal association with a terrorist enterprise"" with alleged connections to terrorist networks in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. The group's alleged leaders, Mohammed Bensakhria (a.k.a. Meliani, considered one of Osama bin Laden's ""lieutenants"" in Europe), 37, and Slimane Khalfaoui, 29, were given 10 years, and Yacine Akhnouche, 30, was given eight. Bensakhria, the suspected ringleader, was thought to have fled Germany as he was arrested in Spain in 2001 and subsequently extradited to France. Rabah Kadre, 37, who was in detention in the United Kingdom was given six years, and was banned from entering French territory. The six other suspects, who received lesser terms, were convicted for giving logistical support to the plot by providing false documents to other group members.

20,2018 Strasbourg attack,"On the evening of 11 December 2018, a terrorist attack occurred in Strasbourg, France, when a man attacked civilians in the city's busy Christkindelsmärik (Christmas market) with a revolver and a knife, killing five and wounding 11 before fleeing in a taxi. Authorities called the shooting an act of terrorism.
The attacker was 29-year-old Chérif Chekatt, who had multiple criminal convictions and was on a security services watchlist as a suspected Islamist extremist. Chekatt was killed in a shootout with French police on the evening of 13 December after a manhunt involving 700 officers. He had pledged allegiance to the terrorist organisation Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) judicial sources said.

Background
Christkindelsmärik is the Alsatian dialect name of the Christmas market in Strasbourg, held annually on the square in front of the Strasbourg Cathedral since 1570. In 2000, a bombing plot was foiled by the French and German police when Al-Qaeda-linked operatives had planned to detonate pressure cookers rigged as bombs in the crowd at the Christkindelsmärik. Since then, the market has been under reinforced security. In 2016, several people were arrested in Marseille and Strasbourg for planning a terrorist attack; officials considered cancelling the Christmas market, but it was ultimately held as scheduled.
On the morning of 11 December 2018, the police raided the home of Chérif Chekatt in Neudorf with the intention of arresting him on suspicion of attempted murder. He was not at home, but they found a stun grenade, a loaded .22 calibre rifle, four knives, and ammunition.

Attack
The attack started at approximately 19:50 local time (18:50 UTC) near Place Kléber, where the Christkindelsmärik was being held. Chérif Chekatt entered the area through Pont du Corbeau, then went through Rue des Orfèvres, opening fire and stabbing people in three different locations, first at Carré-d'Or (Rue des Orfèvres), then Rue des Grandes-Arcades. The attack lasted ten minutes and took place in multiple streets, during which time Chekatt was heard shouting ""Allahu akbar"" as he attacked members of the crowd. He then exchanged fire with soldiers of Opération Sentinelle, and then with the National Police; a soldier was hit in the hand, and Chekatt was shot in the arm. A 45-year-old Thai tourist was hit in the head in front of a restaurant and died, despite a passersby attempting to resuscitate him; ambulances took over 45 minutes to arrive.
Chekatt then escaped in the direction of Neudorf and Place de l'Étoile, taking a taxi cab; the driver was unharmed and reported to the police having taken an armed and wounded man. His testimony allowed the police to identify the gunman, as the man bragged about killing people and having a grenade at home. Two days after the attack, Chekatt's gun was revealed to be a Modèle 1892 revolver.
Initially, 350 personnel of the security forces hunted for Chekatt, supported by air units. Five hundred more personnel joined the next day, with a further 1,300 planned to join as reinforcements. The incident led to the closure of locations around the city, including the European Parliament building. Police used Twitter to relay information to the public. The French government raised their security threat level to the highest possible as the search continued, though Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet stated on Public Sénat that a state of emergency would not be declared for the incident. Five thousand people were stranded in a sports facility used as temporary shelter, and the European Parliament was put on lockdown. President Antonio Tajani tweeted that the European Parliament ""will not be intimidated by terrorist or criminal attacks"" and will ""continue to work and react, strengthened by freedom and democracy against terrorist violence"". The incident was declared an act of terrorism by French authorities.

Victims
Five people were killed; two died at the scene and three others in hospital, while 11 others were injured, four critically. The first of the dead to be identified was a 45-year-old male tourist from Thailand who was shot multiple times and died at the scene. He was on holiday with his wife, who was also shot, but survived. The others were a French 61-year-old former bank employee; a 45-year-old local male mechanic and Muslim originally from Afghanistan who died two days later, Antonio Megalizzi, a 29-year-old journalist from Italy covering the European Parliament plenary session, who died on 14 December; and Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski, a 36-year-old French-Polish national who died on 16 December.

Attacker
The perpetrator was Chérif Chekatt (French pronunciation: [ʃɛʁif ʃɛkat]), a 29-year-old man born of a retired national French-Algerian delivery driver, characterised as a ""hardened criminal"" who ""converted to rigorous Islam"".
According to French authorities, Chekatt had been known to police since the age of 10 and he had his first criminal conviction by age 13. He was known to security services for a total of 27 convictions in France, Germany, and Switzerland, arising from 67 recorded crimes in France alone. His criminal activities started with petty crime, robbery and drug dealing.
French police considered him a ""gangster-jihadist"", a term referring to people convicted of various crimes and ""radicalised"" in prison. Chekatt was released from prison in France in 2015, then received a prison sentence for theft in Singen, Germany and was expelled to France after his release in 2017.
Chekatt was tagged with a fiche ""S"" (""State Security"" file), a type of extra-judiciary document that French State Security uses to keep track of suspect individuals while not necessarily keeping surveillance on them. He was listed for his recent ""religious radicalisation"" and for ""Islamic extremism"". Neighbours said that he seemed quite ordinary, comparing him to his more traditional brother. His German lawyer told media that ""he was just an ordinary criminal. It was no special case. We didn't notice any radicalisation."" Secretary of State Laurent Nuñez stated that Chekatt had become a ""terrorism apologist"" in prison, but had not been expected to perform an attack. On the morning of the attack, local police had attempted to arrest him in relation to an attempted murder, but they could not locate him because Chekatt's father had warned him by SMS that the gendarmes were about to arrest him.
Investigators subsequently concluded that Chekatt had made extensive preparations for the attack. He told fellow inmates in 2015 that he would ""commit a robbery before departing for Syria or die a martyr"", and became ""very interested in seeking weapons"", according to a friend of the jihadist, Audrey Mondjehi.

Manhunt and Chekatt's death
An investigation was initiated for ""murder and acts of terrorism in relation to a criminal enterprise"". Four people close to Chekatt were detained for questioning after the shooting, namely his father, who is tagged with a fiche ""S"" as well because of his religious fundamentalism, his mother, and two of his brothers, both known for their local Salafist affiliation, and a fifth person was taken into custody on 13 December. A search warrant was issued in Algeria for a ""very radicalised"" third brother, who has his own fiche ""S"" record because of radicalisation and ""contacts with Islamist circles in Strasbourg"".
Chekatt was still at large after the attack, and an international manhunt began. There were some initial fears that he had escaped to Germany across the Rhine. Immediate efforts for the manhunt included closing the city's A35 autoroute that leads to Switzerland and Germany, a coordinated security reinforcement between Strasbourg and German state police, and suspending the tramway between the city and Kehl in Germany. Ultimately, more than 700 officers were involved in the manhunt. On 12 December at 19:20 (18:20 UTC), the French National Police released a photograph of Chekatt and asked for any witnesses to come forward.
On the evening of 13 December, police found Chekatt in Strasbourg between Neudorf and the Stade de la Meinau. He fired on officers when they tried to question him and they returned fire, killing him.
Soon after his death, the Islamic State claimed him as one of their ""soldiers"" through their propaganda outlet, Amaq. Christophe Castaner, France's interior minister, dismissed the claim as ""completely opportunistic"". In an interview for France 2, Chekatt's father said his son had been an Islamic State supporter. Nine days after Chekatt's death, a USB key containing a video of him pledging allegiance to the Islamic State was found among his belongings, judicial sources said.

Reactions
The leader of the Rassemblement National (RN) party, Marine Le Pen, described the attack as an ""Islamist massacre"". Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the conservative party Les Républicains, called for a strengthening of the laws.
Border controls were increased due to Strasbourg's proximity to Germany. The Christmas market was closed on the day after the attack.

Conspiracy theories
Conspiracy theorists and some members of the yellow vests movement, which was ongoing at the time of the attack, commented on social media that the shooting was a false flag conspiracy by the French president, to distract attention from the movement's protests. This prompted angry denials from cabinet ministers, who called the claims ""disgusting"".

On 3 April 2024, a court in Paris sentenced Audrey Mondjehi to 30 years in prison for his role in providing the gun Chekatt used in the attack but acquitted him of the specific charge of complicity in the ""terrorist murders"", supporting Mondjehi's defence that he was unaware of where the weapon was to be used for. Two other suspects were also convicted of helping Chekatt and were sentenced to five years' imprisonment, while a third suspect was acquitted. Mondjehi expressed regret for his actions.

22,"Christkindlmarket, Chicago","Christkindlmarket is a Christmas market held annually at Daley Plaza in Chicago, Illinois, United States.  The festival attracts more than 1 million visitors each year.

History
The German American Chamber of Commerce of the Midwest first held Chicago's Christkindlmarket on Pioneer Court in 1996. Christkindlmarket was inspired by the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, Germany.  In 1997, Mayor Daley requested that the festival be moved to Daley Plaza.  That year the market attracted more than 750,000 visitors.  By 1999, the Christkindlmarket had become part of the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival.  In recent years, Chicago's Christkindlmarket has become the largest Christmas market in the United States, hosting well over 1 million visitors annually. In 2016, Christkindlmarket expanded to the Chicago suburb of Naperville. Four years later, a virtual market took place. In 2023, the Christkindlmarket also took place in Aurora, Illinois, and Wrigleyville. That year, they ran out of mugs.

Vendors and attractions
The market is situated by a large Christmas tree at Daley Plaza and also houses a small nativity scene. The site features entertainment from Christmas choirs, dance groups, and brass bands.  It also houses a Santa house. At the site beer, wine, baked goods, meats, toys, holiday ornaments, and other Christmas decorations are sold by vendors from Germany, Ukraine, Austria, and the Chicago metropolitan area.

24,Christkindlmarkt at Marienplatz,"The Christkindlmarkt at Marienplatz is a Christmas market at Marienplatz in Munich.

History
The largest and oldest Christmas market in Munich was first documented as a Nikolaimarkt (Nikolausmarkt) in 1310, making it one of the oldest Christmas markets in the German-speaking world. In 1806, the Nikolaimarkt was renamed the Christmarkt. Since 1972, the market has found its place of business on the Marienplatz after several changes of location. Over the last few years, the exhibition area has been extended considerably (e.g. Rindermarkt). The organizer is the cultural office of the city administration.

Description
With around 140 market stands, it now has around three million visitors every year from all over the world. In addition to the extensive musical-cultural accompanying program, the almost 30-meter-high Christmas tree in front of the town hall, with around 2,500 lights, is donated every year to the citizens of Munich by a different town from Austria or Italy. As a reward for the gift, the municipality can present itself in the inner courtyard of the town hall and operate a Glühwein stand. The high interest of non-municipal communities for this in this self-presentation position, forced the organizers to create a multi-faceted waiting list. The market is usually open daily from the Friday before the first Advent Sunday, until Christmas Eve.
To the west of the Marienplatz, in the direction of Stachus, is the so-called Kripperlmarkt. More than ten stands around the Richard Strauss fountain in the Neuhauserstraße offer only Nativity scenes, figures, and other accessories. There are also some market stands offering food and drinks.
The Kripperlmarkt in the Munich pedestrian zone is open daily and also closes on 24 December (Christmas Eve) at 2 pm.

25,Frankfurt Christmas Market,"The Frankfurt Christmas Market (German: Frankfurter Weihnachtsmarkt) is one of the oldest Christmas markets (also known as ""Weihnachtsmärkte"") in Germany with origins that date back to 1393. It is an annual outdoor Christmas market held in central Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. The market is open during the period of Advent (from late November and continues until just before Christmas on 22 December). It is visited by approximately three million visitors each year.
The market occupies a large area of the old town in central Frankfurt, including Friedrich-Stoltze-Platz, Hauptwache (to the north), Mainkai, Paulsplatz, and Römerberg (to the south).
There are a number of affiliated markets, including in Birmingham, England.

History
In 1393, the first Christmas market in Frankfurt, Germany, was documented. During this era, Christmas didn't hold the same cultural significance as it does today. The primary purpose of the market was to offer citizens the chance to purchase essential items before the arrival of winter. Unlike fairs, only residents of Frankfurt were allowed to set up stalls.
During the Middle Ages, mystery plays were performed at Christmas Markets, with origins possibly tracing back to 941 CE. It was during this period that King Otto I spent Christmas at the Royal Palace of Frankfurt and attended Christmas Mass at the Salvatorkirche. As King Otto exited the church, his estranged brother, Heinrich, knelt before him and begged for forgiveness, which Otto granted. This scene was later immortalized in a painting by Alfred Rethel in 1840, now housed in the Historical Museum.

During the 19th century, the Christmas market started to evolve into the form that is recognizable today. It became more prevalent to decorate and showcase Christmas trees, with Saxon houses being authorized to sell them in the Roman halls. In accordance with the magistrate's decree, only items associated with the Christmas season were allowed to be sold, including toys for children, Christmas trees, gingerbread, and other confectionery products.
Illustrations from the mid-19th century depict scenes resembling those seen today at Römerberg –  bustling markets teeming with small stalls. In 1851, author Heinrich Hoffmann published his Christmas fairy tale, ""King Nutcracker and Poor Reinhold."" The original edition featured a handwritten drawing by Hoffmann himself, showcasing the Frankfurt Christmas market. The tale narrates the dream of a sick boy, who is led to a toy kingdom by King Nutcracker. Upon awakening, he discovers the same toys under his Christmas tree. This marks the earliest known story featuring a nutcracker as a prominent character. Subsequently, in the 1870s, Seiffen in the Ore Mountains began producing turned nutcrackers, which have since become a popular item at Christmas markets.
During the Second World War, the historic setting of the Frankfurt Christmas market was destroyed during Allied air raids. In the post-war period, the market was held in various locations around the city, as the Römerberg was a construction site due to the erection of the subway system in the late 1960s and early 1970s. By the 1970s, the market was able to return to its traditional location. Following the reconstruction of the East Row in the Saturday Mountain in 1983, it has become a popular tourist attraction.
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, the city of Frankfurt cancelled the Christmas market planned for 23 November to 22 December and, in its place, Tourismus+Congress GmbH Frankfurt am Main made digital content available as an online Christmas market on the Internet.

26,"Christmas Market, Stuttgart","Stuttgart Christmas Market, known in German as the Stuttgarter Weihnachtsmarkt is a Christmas market that takes place every year during Advent in the German city of Stuttgart.

History
The Stuttgarter Weihnachtsmarkt was first mentioned in city records in 1692 when it was described as a 'traditional Stuttgart event'. The modern Christmas Market encompasses around 200 stands and is visited by around 3.6 million people every year, making it one of the largest of its kind in Germany. In terms of area, Stuttgart Christmas Market is claimed by organisers to the one in Europe with most tradition.

Location
The market stretches from the west and northern edge of Stuttgart's central square (Schlossplatz, where there is a children's 'fairytale land' alongside a miniature railway and ice rink) to the old squares and alleyways of Stuttgart, including Schillerplatz, Karlsplatz (featuring a Finnish Christmas Market and a Christmas collectors' fair) and Marktplatz. 
The Christmas market opens every year on the last Thursday in November in the Renaissance inner quadrangle of Stuttgart Old Castle. It is open Monday to Saturday from 10am to 9pm and on Sundays from 11am to 9pm. The market finishes on Christmas Eve.

27,Christmas Markets in Berlin,"There are over 80 Christmas markets in various parts of Berlin, where craftspeople demonstrate their skills and sell their wares along with many other Christmas gifts and fairground attractions. The first Christmas market took place in 1530 in Alt-Berlin.

History
The earliest references to events similar to Christmas markets date back to around 1530 and can be found in the municipal register of Cölln. These were first held in the streets between Petriplatz – Gertraudenstraße – Köllnischer Fischmarkt – Mühlendamm – Molkenmarkt – Poststraße and Heiligegeiststraße. According to Jutta Schneider, ""stall holders were explicitly allowed to trade honey cake and other types of syrup based pastries at the Petriplatz and the fish market of Cölln in exchange for a stall fee of two Groschen a day during the Christmas season"".
In 1750, the city council moved the trading, which originally lasted from 11 December to 6 January, to the Breite Straße. Later on the Christmas market expanded in the direction of the Schlossplatz and remained in the city center until 1873. Since 1872, 27 December has marked the end of the selling season. However, there have been repeated attempts to keep the market off the streets, as it led to significant traffic disruptions in the inner city. Furthermore, Breite Straße store owners feared the Christmas market would compromise their sales, saying the market was ""a thoroughly obsolete institution for traders, not befitting the conditions and grandeur of the capital of the Reich anymore.""
In 1873, the Lustgarten (Pleasure Garden) was chosen as the new location, but it was moved to Arkonastraße in 1891, with an interruption during World War I, because of safety considerations and the construction of the Berlin Cathedral. Between 1937 and 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, the market returned to the Lustgarten. During its peak there were up to 2000 merchants.
During the first peacetime winter in 1945, a Christmas market took place again in the Lustgarten, although it was in the middle of ruins and food and drink were restricted to specific brands.
After 1948, as a result of the division of Berlin into 2 different currency areas, Christmas markets were established in West Berlin with locations at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, in Spandau and the Town Hall in Wedding.
In East Berlin, the organizers stuck to the old location until 1974. In the years 1952 and 1953, there was a ""Liliput railway"" (gauge 381 mm), a forerunner of the pioneer railway Wuhlheide operated by the ""Young Railway Workers"" society at the Christmas market around the Lustgarten, the demolished Berlin Palace and the Schlossplatz.Around 1960, the small streets of the Christmas market on the Marx-Engels-Platz were heated by infrared lights. Even after the Palace of the Republic was completed in 1974, the entire Marx-Engels-Platz continued to serve as a venue. Additionally, between 1962 and 1968 they chose a large carpark at Alexanderplatz, an area next to the Sports Hall in the Karl-Marx-Allee was added. Apart from the district of Mitte, there were soon short-term Christmas markets in each of the former districts, mainly around each Town Hall.
A Christmas market, which occupied half of the exhibition halls in West Berlin, was held in the exhibition square in West Berlin and took place in 1983. This Christmas market, under Funkturm took place exclusively in the halls and was more like a Christmas and toy exhibition. Other places independent of the weather included: a children's theatre, a hall with cribs from all over the world and another with model trains. The market was abandoned in favour of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.

In addition to the shops, there are historic children's carousels and a Ferris wheel on Spandauer Street, and an ice rink around the Neptune Fountain. Because of the excavation for the underground line U5 in front of the Red Town Hall and the reconstruction of St. Mary's Church churchyard, these markets were downsized in 2014 and it was decided to leave out the chain carousels.

28,Rindermarkt,"The Rindermarkt is one of the oldest streets in Munich, which connects to the Marienplatz in the north through the former Inner Sendlinger Tor. Its continuation today forms the Sendlinger Straße, which leads to the (outer) Sendlinger Tor.

Originally, this street was used as a cattle marketplace, from which the name of the street derives. Later, noble patricians built their homes here. During the Second World War, the houses on Rindermarkt were badly affected. During the reconstruction, the original roads were extended in the direction of Oberanger to today's place. Only the north side of today's Rindermarkt still follows the old street routes. Today, the Munich Rindermarkt acts as a haven in the midst of the old town of Munich. Many traditional companies and retail shops have settled there. During the Advent time, the Kripperlmarkt took place there until 2011 as part of the traditional Christmas markets.

Buildings on Rindermarkt

The church of St. Peter, Munich's oldest parish church, whose tower is colloquially called ""Alter Peter"", bears the number Rindermarkt 1 and marks the northern end of Rindermarkt towards Marienplatz.
The Rindermarkt fountain represents a sitting shepherd watching over three cattle.
The Lion Tower on the southeastern side of Rindermarkt is a 15th-century water tower, with frescoes of birds, trees and characters.
The Ruffinihaus from 1905, is actually a group of three houses at Rindermarkt 10, which are particularly richly decorated. A fresco on the facade shows the Ruffiniturm (former Inner Sendlinger Tor), which stood nearby at the end of Rosenstraße.

29,"Christkindlesmarkt, Nuremberg","Christkindlesmarkt is a Christmas market that is held annually in Nuremberg, Germany. It takes place during Advent in the Hauptmarkt, the central square in Nuremberg’s old town, and in adjoining squares and streets. With about two million visitors a year the Nürnberger Christkindlesmarkt is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany and one of the most famous in the world. Every year the Christmas market begins on the Friday preceding the first Sunday in Advent and ends on 24 December unless that day is a Sunday.

History
Despite intense investigations carried out by several historians and people interested in local history, the origins of the Nürnberger Christkindlesmarkt are unknown. The oldest piece of evidence relating to it is a box made of coniferous wood. On the bottom can be found the following inscription: ""Regina Susanna Harßdörfferin from the virgin Susanna Eleonora Erbsin (or Elbsin) sent to the Kindles-Marck in 1628"". The box is currently in the possession of the Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg.
In official documents, the words Kindleinbescheren (handing out presents to children) or Weihnachtszeit (Christmas time) are used from 1610 onwards. It is not clear, however, whether these words have anything to do with the Christkindlesmarkt. Historians assume that the market has its origins in traditional sales at the weekly market between 1610 and 1639 and that it gradually evolved into an independent market. Originally, the market opened on Thomas’ Day, 4 December. Due to the large number of visitors, opening day was rescheduled to the Friday before the start of Advent in 1973 and has remained so ever since. There were no markets between 1939 and 1948.

Location
The original location of the Christkindlesmarkt was the Nuremberg Hauptmarkt. It was, however, relocated to other places such as the Fleischbrücke or the island Schütt between 1898 and 1933. In 1933, the market returned to its original venue in front of the Frauenkirche church.

Christkind
Christkindlesmarkt could be translated word for word as ""Christ Child Market"". The Nuremberg Christkind, or Christ Child, a young woman dressed in white and gold, with curly blond hair, a tall golden crown and angel-wing-like long golden sleeves, is an important part of the market. Initially impersonated by an actress, since 1969 the Christkind has been elected every second year among local girls between 16 and 19 years of age. A large number of competitors enter via the Internet, finally, a jury chooses the next Christkind out of several finalists who have to be at least 1,60m tall and free from giddiness as the Christkind has to make her speech from the church balcony, secured with a rope, possibly in inclement winter weather. Besides the opening speech on every Friday evening, the Christkind appears in schools, hospitals etc. In 2015 Barbara Otto succeeded Teresa Treuheit.

Prologue
The Christkindlesmarket is opened with a prologue speech by the Christkind from the balcony of the Frauenkirche church. This solemn event attracts thousands of people to the Hauptmarkt. The prologue, written by Friedrich Bröger for the first post-war market in 1948, was modified several times since as the largely destroyed city was rebuilt and the hungry population became prosperous again. It begins, and ends, with an invitation to the ladies and gentlemen who have been children once and to the little ones at the beginning of the journey of life, and compares short-term events like the temporary market little city made of wood and cloth to timeless values, memories and traditions.

Sister city market
In Rathausplatz the sister city market has taken place since 1998. The sister cities provide booths with local specialties. These cities are: Antalya (Turkey), Atlanta (USA), Vienna (Austria), Kharkiv (Ukraine), Gera (Germany), Glasgow (Scotland), Kavala (Greece), Kraków (Poland), Nice (France), Prague (Czech Republic), San Carlos (Nicaragua), Shenzhen (China), Skopje (North Macedonia), Venice (Italy) and Limousin (French region). Moreover, there are friend cities like Bar (Montenegro), Kalkudah (Sri Lanka), Verona (Italy) present at the market.

30,Dortmund Christmas Market,"The Dortmund Christmas Market (in German: Dortmunder Weihnachtsmarkt ) is an annual outdoor Christmas market held every year in central Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With more than three and a half million visitors of 300 stalls, it is one of the biggest Christmas markets of the world and brings tourists from all over the world to Dortmund. It is estimated that the city benefits of a 100 million Euros profit from this 38-day-long tradition.
The Christmas tree of Dortmund Weihnachtsmark is the largest natural Christmas tree in the world.

History
The market's origins date back to 1878. There were no markets between 1939 and 1948. In recent years, Dortmund Weihnachtsmarkt has become the largest Christmas market in Germany, hosting well over 3.5 million visitors annually.
The Christmas market opens in late November and continues until just before New Year's Eve (normally 30 December). It occupies a large area in central Dortmund, including Alter Markt around the St. Reinold's Church, Hansaplatz, Kleppingstraße, and Westenhellweg.

Vendors and attractions
Today the most famous features of Dortmund Weihnachtsmark are the world's largest Christmas tree with more than 45 meters. The tree is made of 1,700 spruces from Sauerland. Twenty huge candles and 48,000 lights shine over the Christmas market. The top is decorated with a four-meter-high angel. The total weight of this structure at a height of 45 meters is 40 tons.  Foundation laying with glühwein and bratwurst will take place on 23 October at 4 p.m. at Hansaplatz. Workers needed four weeks to assemble the red spruces.
Christmas Village

Situated on the Dortmund Weihnachtsmarkt is a children's adventure world called 'Weihnachtsdorf' (in English: 'Christmas Village'). In the Christmas Village children can read poems aloud, sing songs, do crafts and bake. Furthermore, there is the puppet theatre, merry-go-round and a huge Santa chair with a Fairy tale show.

Candle pyramids (Christmas pyramid)
In many parts of Germany, the candle pyramid (light stock) is brought out every year to light up the room at Christmas. Two to five round wooden tiers, gradually smaller towards the top,  are built onto a central rod which rotates, driven by the heat of candles rising up into a rotor at the top. On each tier there are figures connected with Christmas. The whole ornament is usually about 50 cm high, but one of the tallest pyramid in the world takes pride of place at the Dortmund Weihnachtsmarkt, towering a full 12m in the air. Originally, the pyramid was a much simpler affair, simply a frame to hang sprigs of fir upon; the modern-day pyramid did not evolve until the early 19th century.

Alter Markt Stage
The “Alter Markt” stage presents a lively varied series and show programme every day. On 8 December, the popular WDR 4 'Christmas' show will feature international stars on its stage.

Food and drinks
Glühwein (mulled wine)
One tradition in Dortmund is drinking steaming mugs of mulled wine at the Weihnachtsmarkt on a cold December night. The hot red wine spiced with cloves and cinnamon is served in specially decorated mugs. The mug features a different design every year and has become a collector's item.
Glühbier (mulled beer)
Dortmund had more than 550 years of brewing tradition, some of the oldest breweries in Westphalia are founded around the Old Market in Dortmund. A new chapter of the breweries are mulled beer. Mulled beer is a hot beer with honey, brown sugar and winter spices – such as star anise, cinnamon and cardamom.
Reibekuchen (potato fritters)
Reibekuchen may be served with apple sauce, pumpernickel bread, treacle, or with Maggi-brand seasoning sauce. They are often sold at street fairs and markets, such as Christmas markets in Germany.
Dortmunder Salzkuchen (Saltcake)
A Dortmund tradition meal is bread buns with caraway fruits, salt, meat and onions.

Medieval Christmas Market Fredenbaum
Throughout Dortmund opened three Christmas markets, each of which is surrounded by souvenir stalls, a carousel and a Nativity scene installed and its local tree. Europe's largest Medieval Christmas Market can be found at Fredenbaumpark in the north of Downtown which takes place from 23 November every weekend.  Here, there is a rustic atmosphere, live music, culinary delights and gift ideas, as well as a Christmas atmosphere in the torchlight.

31,Leipzig Christmas Market,"The Leipzig Christmas Market (in German: Leipziger Weihnachtsmarkt) is one of the oldest Christmas markets in Germany. It takes place annually from the end of November to 23 December on Leipzig's market square and the adjacent streets and, with around 300 stalls and over 2.8 million visitors (2019), is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany.

History
Its history goes back to 1458. In notes by Johann Jacob Vogel from 1714 there is the note:

""Anno 1458. Frederick II, Elector of Saxony, Marggraff of Meissen and Hertzog of Saxony / publicly advertised the Weynachtsmarckt / and the city / because of the loyal service rendered / as shown to him by the council / and the citizens / thus pardoned.""
This makes it one of the oldest Christmas markets in Germany, alongside the Munich Christmas Market (1310), Bautzen Wenzelsmarkt (1384), Frankfurt Christmas Market (1393) and Dresden Striezelmarkt (1434).
The Christmas markets planned for 2020 and 2021 were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Program of supporting events
The Leipzig Christmas Market 2023 will be opened by the cultural mayor Skadi Jennicke, the Thomanerchor and the Leipzig Youth & Wind Orchestra. Every day at 6 p.m., tower brass players traditionally play from the balcony of the Old Town Hall. Further concerts take place on the market stage. The Ore Mountains Miners' parade is a procession of a brass band with seven miners' bands with 265 mountain musicians and around 370 people in uniform and takes place every two years.

Attractions
The market offers several areas, including a fairytale land for children on Augustusplatz, a historical market on Naschmarkt, a nativity scene with real sheep, an 8 metres (26 ft) tall Ore Mountains Christmas pyramid on Nikolaikirchhof and a Finnish village on Augustusplatz. On the market square there is the approximately 20 metres (66 ft) tall Christmas fir, usually a spruce from the region.
The South Tyrolean village is a popular meeting point on Augustusplatz during the Leipzig Christmas market. Tyrolean dishes are served while listening to Alpine music.
The historic carousel is a special attraction of the Christmas market on Salzgässchen. The carousel, parts of which were over 100 years old, fell victim to a fire due to a short circuit before the market opened in November 2009. In 2010 the carousel was rebuilt true to the original. The “Wichtelwerkstatt” where children can do crafts has existed since 2010 and was completely renovated and reopened in 2017.
A special and widely celebrated Leipzig tradition is the arrival of Santa Claus in the city. Every year on the Saturday before the Advent Sunday at 11 a.m., numerous children and their parents welcome Santa Claus and his entourage at the main station, where he arrives on a special train. They then escort his carriage and brass band across the city to the market square. Santa Claus will hold his office hours there every day until the end of the Christmas market.
Another attraction at the Christmas market was the largest free-standing Advent calendar in the world, which was installed from 1997 to 2012 and, at 857 square metres (9,225 sq ft), according to the Guinness Book of Records, was on the facade of a house in Böttchergässchen with 3 metres (10 ft) by 2 metres (7 ft) windows. It was played by students from Leipzig schools and the ″Musikschule Leipzig Johann Sebastian Bach"". Due to damage caused by vandalism, the calendar was no longer installed in 2013.

Offer
Around a third of the stands offer baked goods and confectionery such as roasted almonds, Pulsnitzer gingerbread or Stollen, as well as other food and drinks. The largest proportion are high-quality dealers, showmen and craftsmen. Among other things, wood carvings from Ore Mountain folk art and other handicrafts are on offer.

32,Striezelmarkt,"The Striezelmarkt in Dresden is one of the first genuine Christmas markets in the world. Founded as a one-day market in 1434, it celebrated its 585th anniversary in 2019. Its 240 stands attract about 3 million visitors from all over the world. The annual market lasts throughout the Advent season until Christmas Eve.

History and naming
This market event was first mentioned in 1434, under Friedrich II, Elector of Saxony, when it was held the Monday before Christmas on the Altmarkt square. Originally, it was a one-day market to provide the citizens of Dresden with the sale of meat for the Christmas meal after the traditional Advent period of fasting.
In the 21st century, the Striezelmarkt has developed into a huge event with 240 stands. It takes up a large part of Dresden city centre and lasts throughout the Advent period until Christmas Eve.
The word Striezelmarkt comes from Strüzel or Stroczel, which was the name of a type of cake sold at the market; it is now widely known as Stollen or Christstollen. Stollen is a light airy fruitcake that is quite low in sugar, and today is available in many parts of the world. The true Dresden Stollen, however, is produced in the city and distinguished by a special seal depicting Augustus II, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. The shape of the cake is meant to be reminiscent of the entrance to a mine tunnel (the literal meaning of Stollen), reflecting the area's silver and tin mining history.

Features of today's Striezelmarkt
Today the most famous features of Dresden Striezelmarkt are the world's largest usable Christmas arch with a breadth of 13.5 metres (44 ft) and a height of more than 5 metres (16 ft) and the 14-metre (46 ft) high Erzgebirge Christmas pyramid. Situated on the Dresden Striezelmarkt is a children's adventure world. Here, the prune chimney sweep’s cottage and the bakery are open for kneading and arts and crafts. A puppet theatre, merry-go-round, and a children's railway are also operating. On the Dresden Striezelmarkt, a daily stage programme takes place. During Advent weekends, special events such as Dresden Stollen Festival and Pyramid and Christmas Arch Festival take place.
At the centre of the Striezelmarkt stands a 20 metres (66 ft) high spruce, brought from the nearby Tharandt woods and decorated with lights.  At the back of the market square there is a painted wooden fairy-tale castle, designed to operate as a giant Advent calendar. Children's entertainers open a door each day and present a puppet show. On Fridays, Father Christmas himself visits.

Wooden ornaments
Many of the stands at the Striezelmarkt sell carved wooden ornaments of a huge variety of shapes and sizes. This practice dates to the period of the area's mining history. Dresden is the largest city near the Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, where silver and tin were discovered in around 1168. The discovery brought many miners to the area, but they lost their jobs as a result of the German Peasants' War and competition from abroad. Needing a new way to earn money, the miners took up woodcarving, incorporating mining symbols and religious elements into their designs. These symbols can still be found in the Christmas ornaments sold at the Striezelmarkt.
Candle pyramids (Christmas pyramid)
In many parts of Germany, the candle pyramid (lightstock) is brought out every year to light up the room at Christmas. Two to five round wooden tiers, gradually smaller towards the top, are built onto a central rod. The tiers rotate, driven by the heat of candles rising up into a rotor at the top. On each tier there are figures connected with Christmas. The whole ornament is usually about 50 cm (20 in) high. The tallest pyramid in the world dominates the Striezelmarkt, towering a full 14 m (46 ft) in the air. Originally, the pyramid was a much simpler affair, simply a frame to hang sprigs of fir upon. The modern-day pyramid was not developed until the early 19th century.
Schwibbogen
Literally, the word Schwibbogen means an arch ""hanging"" (schweben) above you, between two walls. This candle-holder is arch-shaped, representing the arched entrance to a mine hung with guiding lights; it is another connection to the area's mining past. Today the ""candles"" are often lit with electricity. The scenes cut from the wooden centre of the arch are not only on mining themes. At night during Advent, nearly every single window in Dresden is lit with these ornaments, traditionally bought at the Striezelmarkt.
Räuchermann (smoking man)
Another ornament always present at Christmas-time in Germany, the smoking man is hollowed out with a hole leading to his mouth, hung with a pipe. An incense candle is placed inside him so that he appears to smoke as it burns. Variations on the smoking man include old ladies in rocking chairs, Father Christmases, and figures representing nearly every occupation. Smoking men first appeared in the Striezelmarkt in the 19th century.
Nutcrackers
The type of nutcracker traditionally sold at the Striezelmarkt, carved and painted with a red coat like a soldier, probably became popular world-wide thanks to Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and related ballets. The first wood turner to carve the ornaments in this form, Wilhelm Friedrich Füchtner from the Ore Mountains, is said to have been inspired by the nutcracker in the story book Tchaikovsky drew from for his ballet.

Food and drinks
Apart from the famous Stollen, other specialities originate from Dresden and were originally sold at the Striezelmarkt.

Pflaumentoffel
Although they are made of prunes, these little figures are really decorations, although they can be eaten after Christmas. Pflaumentoffel means plum devil; (also called Feuerrüpel or Fiery Santa), although they are not meant to be devils or Santas, but chimney sweeps, all dressed in black (the prunes) with a top hat and a brush. Until the 20th century, Pflaumentoffel were sold at the Striezelmarkt on trays carried by children trying to earn some Christmas money. The artist Ludwig Richter famously portrayed these Striezelkinder in 1853 in his woodcut ""Ausverkauft wegen Geschäftsaufgabe"" (""Sold out as giving up business""). In 1910, however, sale by children was banned at the Striezelmarkt.
Pulsnitzer Pfefferkuchen (Pulsnitz gingerbread)
The Christmas market at Nuremberg (Christkindlmarkt) is more famous for its gingerbread known as Lebkuchen, but the Striezelmarkt's gingerbread has nearly as long a history. Pfefferkuchen literally means ""pepper cake"": the word ""pepper"" was used to mean any new foreign spice. The gingerbread sold at the Striezelmarkt comes from Pulsnitz, a town about 50 km from Dresden; it was first mentioned as a speciality from Pulsnitz in a decree issued in 1558 allowing bakers to produce it there. Pfefferkuchen are usually filled with marmalade or jam and covered with chocolate. Unlike gingerbread from other countries, the dough does not usually contain any fat, or indeed ginger, but instead nutmeg, cinnamon, ground cloves and allspice, which are added after the dough has been left up to 6 months to mature. In 1780 eight master bakers came personally from Pulsnitz to sell their wares at the Striezelmarkt; today there are many more Pfefferkuchen stands, but the gingerbread is usually sold by hired staff.
Glühwein (mulled wine)
One very well-loved tradition on a cold December night in Dresden is drinking steaming mugs of mulled wine at the Striezelmarkt. The hot red wine spiced with cloves and cinnamon is served in specially decorated mugs.

33,Winchester Cathedral Christmas Market,"Winchester Cathedral Christmas Market is a Christmas market held each year in the grounds of Winchester Cathedral, in the city of Winchester in the English county of Hampshire. Typically the market operates from the middle of November until a few days before Christmas Day.  
The market was founded in 2006, and has operated every year since with the exception of 2020, when it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The market hosts around 120 German-inspired chalets, selling a range of art and craft items, seasonal gifts, food and drink. Originally these were complemented by an outdoor ice rink, but from 2021 that was replaced by a performance stage that hosts a variety of performances. 
Access to the market is free of change and booking is not required, but queues may develop at busy times.

34,River Thames frost fairs,"The River Thames frost fairs were held on the tideway of the River Thames in London, England in some winters, starting at least as early as the late 7th century until the early 19th century. Most were held between the early 17th and early 19th centuries during the period known as the Little Ice Age, when the river froze over most often, though still infrequently. During that time the British winter was more severe than it is now, and the river was wider and slower, further impeded by the 19 piers of the medieval Old London Bridge which were removed in 1831.
Even at its peak, in the mid-17th century, the Thames in London froze less often than modern legend sometimes suggests, never exceeding about one year in ten except for four winters between 1649 and 1666. From 1400 until the removal of the medieval London Bridge in 1831, there were 24 winters in which the Thames was recorded to have frozen over at London. The Thames freezes over more often upstream, beyond the reach of the tide, especially above the weirs, of which Teddington Lock is the lowest. The last great freeze of the higher Thames was in 1962–63.
Frost fairs were a rare event even in the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age. Some of the recorded frost fairs were in 695, 1608, 1683–84, 1716, 1739–40, 1789, and 1814. Recreational cold weather winter events were far more common elsewhere in Europe, for example in the Netherlands, where at least many canals often froze over. These events in other countries as well as the winter festivals and carnivals around the world in present times can also be considered frost fairs. However, very few of them have actually used that title.
During the Great Frost of 1683–84, the most severe freeze recorded in England, the Thames was completely frozen for two months, with the ice reaching a thickness of 11 inches (28 cm) in London. Solid ice was reported extending for miles off the coasts of the southern North Sea (England, France and the Low Countries), causing severe problems for shipping and preventing the use of many harbours.

Historical background
One of the earliest accounts of the Thames freezing comes from AD 250, when it was frozen solid for six weeks. In 923, the river was open to wheeled traffic for trade and the transport of goods for 13 weeks. In 1410, it lasted for 14 weeks.
The period from the mid-14th century to the 19th century in Europe is called the Little Ice Age because of the severity of the climate, especially the winters. In England, when the ice was thick enough and lasted long enough, Londoners would take to the river for travel, trade, and entertainment, the latter eventually taking the form of public festivals and fairs.
The Thames was broader and shallower in the Middle Ages – it was yet to be embanked, meaning that it flowed more slowly. Moreover, old London Bridge, which carried a row of shops and houses on each side of its roadway, was supported on many closely spaced piers; these were protected by large timber casings which, over the years, were extended – causing a narrowing of the arches below the bridge, thus concentrating the water into swift-flowing torrents. In winter, large pieces of ice would lodge against these timber casings, gradually blocking the arches and acting like a dam for the river at ebb tide.

The frost fairs
AD 695 (first known frost fair)
The first known frost fair on the River Thames was in AD 695, although it was not known by the title of frost fair. The river froze over for six weeks. Vendors set up booths on the frozen river in which they sold goods.

1608 (first frost fair that was called a frost fair)
The first recorded frost fair for which the term ""frost fair"" was used was in 1608.  There were barbers, pubs, fruitsellers and shoemakers, who lit fires inside of their tents to stay warm. Activities at the frost fair included football, and according to an article published in The Saturday Magazine in 1835, dancing, nine-pin bowling, and unlicensed gambling.

1683–84
The most celebrated frost fair occurred in the winter of 1683–84.  Activities included horse and coach racing, ice skating, puppet plays and bull-baiting, as well as football, nine-pin bowling, sledding, fox hunting, and throwing at cocks.
John Evelyn's account of the 1683-84 frost fair:

Coaches plied from Westminster to the Temple, and from several other stairs too and fro, as in the streets; sleds, sliding with skeetes, a bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet plays and interludes, cooks, tipling and other lewd places, so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water.
For sixpence, the printer Croom sold souvenir cards written with the customer's name, the date, and the fact that the card was printed on the Thames; he was making five pounds a day (ten times a labourer's weekly wage). King Charles II bought one. The cold weather was not only a cause for merriment, as Evelyn explained:

The fowls, fish and birds, and all our exotic plants and greens universally perishing. Many parks of deer were destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear that there were great contributions to keep the poor alive...London, by reason for the excessive coldness of the air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous steam of the sea-coal ...that one could hardly breath.

An eye-witness account of the 1683–84 frost:

On the 20th of December, 1688 [misprint for 1683], a very violent frost began, which lasted to the 6th of February, in so great extremity, that the pools were frozen 18 inches thick at least, and the Thames was so frozen that a great street from the Temple to Southwark was built with shops, and all manner of things sold. Hackney coaches plied there as in the streets. There were also bull-baiting, and a great many shows and tricks to be seen. This day the frost broke up. In the morning I saw a coach and six horses driven from Whitehall almost to the bridge (London Bridge) yet by three o'clock that day, February the 6th, next to Southwark the ice was gone, so as boats did row to and fro, and the next day all the frost was gone. On Candlemas Day I went to Croydon market, and led my horse over the ice to the Horseferry from Westminster to Lambeth; as I came back I led him from Lambeth upon the middle of the Thames to Whitefriars' stairs, and so led him up by them. And this day an ox was roasted whole, over against Whitehall. King Charles and the Queen ate part of it.
Thames frost fairs were often brief, scarcely commenced before the weather lifted and the people had to retreat from the melting ice. Rapid thaws sometimes caused loss of life and property. In January 1789, melting ice dragged a ship which was anchored to a riverside public house, pulling the building down and causing five people to be crushed to death.

18th century
There were frost fairs in 1715–16, 1739–40, and 1789.

Frost fair, 1814 (last frost fair)
The frost fair of 1814 began on 1 February, and lasted four days, between Blackfriars Bridge and London Bridge. An elephant was led across the river below Blackfriars. Temperatures had been below freezing every night from 27 December 1813 to 7 February 1814 and numerous Londoners made their way onto the frozen Thames.
Tradesmen of all types set up booths to sell their wares, and pedlars circulated through the crowd. Food and drink was being sold including beef, Brunswick Mum, coffee, gin, gingerbread, hot apples, Old Tom gin, roast mutton, hot chocolate, purl (wormwood ale), and black tea. Activities included dancing and nine-pin bowling.
As the ice broke up starting on 5 February, several people drowned.
Nearly a dozen printing presses were also on the ice, producing commemorative poems. A printer named George Davis published a 124-page book, Frostiana; or A History of the River Thames In a Frozen State: and the Wonderful Effects of Frost, Snow, Ice, and Cold, in England, and in Different Parts of the World Interspersed with Various Amusing Anecdotes. The entire book was typeset and printed in Davis's printing stall which had been set up on the frozen Thames. The book contained an account of the frost, humorous sayings, anecdotes, various weather-related histories and specifics about ""skaiting"" according to a 1814 review.
This was the last frost fair. The climate was growing milder; old London Bridge was demolished in 1831 and replaced with a new bridge with wider arches, allowing the tide to flow more freely; and the river was embanked in stages during the 19th century, all of which made the river less likely to freeze. There was nearly a frost fair during the severe winter of 1881, with Andrews (1887) saying, ""it was expected by many that a Frost Fair would once more be held on the Thames"".

Related events
16th century
The Thames froze over several times in the 16th century: King Henry VIII travelled from central London to Greenwich by sleigh along the river in 1536, Queen Elizabeth I took to the ice frequently during 1564, to ""shoot at marks"", and small boys played football on the ice.

Walking from Fulham to Putney 1788–1789
Soon after Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, took residence at Fulham Palace in 1788, he recorded that the year was remarkable ""for a very severe frost the latter end of the year, by which the Thames was so completely frozen over, that Mrs. Porteus and myself walked over it from Fulham to Putney"". The annual register recorded that, in January 1789, the river was ""completely frozen over and people walk to and fro across it with fairground booths erected on it, as well as puppet shows and roundabouts"".

Legacy
Engraving
In the pedestrian tunnel under the southern end of Southwark Bridge, there is an engraving by Southwark sculptor Richard Kindersley, made of five slabs of grey slate, depicting the frost fair.
The frieze contains an inscription that reads (two lines per slab):

The inscription is based on handbills printed on the Thames during the frost fairs.

In popular culture
An early chapter of the novel Orlando: A Biography by Virginia Woolf takes place on the frozen River Thames during the Frost Fair of 1608.
In the historical mystery, The True Confessions of a London Spy by Katherine Cowley key events of the plot occur at the Frost Fair of 1814.
In the book, “One Snowy Night” by Amanda Grange, the characters go to the Frost Fair of 1814. 
In the Doctor Who episode ""A Good Man Goes to War,"" River Song encounters Rory Williams as she is returning to her cell in the Stormcage Containment Facility. She tells him that she has just been to 1814 for the last of the Great Frost Fairs. The Doctor had taken her there for ice-skating on the river Thames. ""He got Stevie Wonder to sing for me under London Bridge,"" she says. When Rory expresses surprise that Stevie Wonder sang in 1814, River cautions him that he must never tell the singer that he did.
The Doctor Who episode ""Thin Ice"" is set during the final frost fair in 1814, and includes a reference to the elephant crossing stunt.

35,Lincoln Christmas Market,"Lincoln Christmas Market, held in Lincoln, England, was one of the largest Christmas markets in Europe, attracting over 250,000 people over the four-day event. It was held from 1982 until 2022.
Held around three weeks before Christmas - from the first Thursday in December to the following Sunday, the market spread around the historic centre of Lincoln including the castle and cathedral. As well as stalls selling goods there was a funfair with Ferris wheel, open air classical music and rock concerts and traditional events such as beer barrel rolling.
The number of visitors was so great that a circular one-way system for pedestrians around the streets of Lincoln is put into place. The route includes travelling through the grounds of Lincoln Castle.

History
Lincoln Christmas Market was the first Christmas market in the United Kingdom. It was first held in 1982, after Council Leader, Jim Sullivan, Bob Hodson and Charles Ireland visited Neustadt an der Weinstrasse (Lincoln's twin town) and were impressed by the Neustadt Christmas Market. When they came back to Lincoln, they set up their own Christmas market consisting of just eleven stalls. The market was cancelled in 2010 due to severe weather conditions both in the city of Lincoln and the surrounding region. This was the first time the market had been cancelled in over 28 years.
In 2017, the last day of the market was cancelled due to the forecast of bad snow. It turned out that the snow never materialised and Lincoln City council were left embarrassed by the decision as they received much criticism from the public and press. The market was held for the last time in 2022.

Train transport
During the weekend of the market, charter trains are organised from around Britain. In 2006 this included Central Trains hiring a Class 47 hauled set from the West Coast Railways, to provide additional and increased capacity services between Leicester, Nottingham and Lincoln railway stations. Hertfordshire Rail Tours organised a charter train from London King's Cross. A train organised by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society travelled down starting from the Scottish town of Linlithgow, then proceeding via Edinburgh and the East Coast Main Line.
In previous years, Central Trains had hired an InterCity 125 set from Midland Mainline for the Nottingham to Lincoln shuttle. Other rail tours for the Christmas Market, including steam-hauled trains, have set out from Blackpool and the London stations of Finsbury Park and London Victoria. Carriages from the classic Venice-Simplon Orient Express train have been used on some of these services.

36,Winter wonderland,"A winter wonderland or Christmas fair is a funfair held mainly in the United Kingdom around the Christmas season. A winter wonderland usually includes attractions such as a German-style Christmas market, Santa's grotto, amusement rides and ice skating rinks. Winter wonderlands range from small-scale single-day events to large city centre fairs lasting several weeks.
Many British cities host winter wonderlands similar to the Christmas markets held on the European continent, with London's Hyde Park Winter Wonderland drawing over 3 million guests in 2019. Independent winter wonderlands are also common, similar in format to a travelling carnival, and the often high prices and poor quality attractions at these have become notorious. Journalist Isabelle Fraser, writing in The Daily Telegraph, described  ""rubbish British Christmas festival"" as being a ""tradition"", and there are regular news stories about these events.

History
In the Little Ice Age, when the European climate was much cooler, frost fairs on frozen rivers provided outdoor skating and other entertainment, but these died out by the 19th century as winters became milder. Winter wonderlands are a relatively recent invention – the UK does not have a tradition of Christmas markets as seen in Germany, and the weather in December is now usually too mild for snow or ice.
The modern British winter wonderland started in the early 2000s, driven by a combination of boosterism by local councils and entrepreneurs. One of the first was the Christmas fair on Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, started in 1999 partly to reduce crowding at Hogmanay following a crowd crush, and which became ""Edinburgh's Christmas"". The Hyde Park Winter Wonderland was another early winter wonderland in the UK, opening in 2005 as a modest funfair organised by The Royal Parks, but it significantly expanded after it was taken over by private enterprise in 2007 and by 2012 the event encompassed ice skating, a ferris wheel, multiple rollercoasters and themed areas such as a Bavarian village, a circus and ""Santa Land"". Other towns and cities followed with similar events, with some of the largest being held in Nottingham, Portsmouth, Norwich, York, Newcastle upon Tyne and Birmingham.

Criticism and ""winter blunderlands""

Winter wonderlands draw large crowds, which means that at peak times they can be extremely loud and busy. Heavy drinking by guests often leads to crowd control problems and violence. Many have also been criticised for being overly commercialised, with high prices and a heavy emphasis on sales, although visitors tend to spend less than they intended to at wonderlands. Heavy stalls and rides as well as footfall from numerous guests damage the ground, especially in typical wet wintry conditions, and it can take months for public parks to recover from the impact of hosting a winter wonderland.
Most have a narrow emphasis on Christmas traditions from central and northern Europe – especially Germany (particularly Bavaria) and the Nordics (particularly Lapland) – which has been noted as being both inauthentic to traditional British Christmas traditions (especially as the UK lacks the regular snow experienced in these areas) and for ignoring the modern diversity of Christmas traditions practised by immigrant communities in major cities such as London.

Following the spread of city-run winter wonderlands came a large number of privately organised events attempting to copy the formula. These events have become notorious for high prices, poor quality and animal welfare violations, and news reports on the most disastrous examples have become a tradition during the Christmas silly season. An early example was the 2008 Lapland New Forest in Hampshire, which charged a £25 entrance fee, with extra fees for the grotto and the market, and became the subject of considerable negative coverage due to its few attractions and long queues, rude staff members, and reindeer and huskies kept in poor conditions. Since then, numerous other attractions have been dubbed ""winter blunderlands"", including Lapland West Midlands in 2008, Milton Keynes Winter Wonderland in 2013, Yorkshire's Magical Winterland and Laurence Llewelyn Bowen's Magical Journey in 2014, Bakewell Winter Wonderland in 2016 and Enchanted at Balgone Estate in 2022.

38,Christmas market,"A Christmas market is a street market associated with the celebration of Christmas during the four weeks of Advent. These markets originated in Germany, but are now held in many countries. Some in the U.S. have adapted the name to the quasi-German Christkindlmarket, substituting market for German Markt.
Christmas markets date to the Late Middle Ages in the German-speaking part of Europe and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire, which included many eastern regions of modern France. They became a popular Advent custom during the Reformation era. Dresden's Striezelmarkt was first held in 1434 and one of the first true Christmas markets; earlier markets of the season were ""December markets"". Early mentions of these ""December markets"" can be found in Vienna (1296), Munich (1310), Bautzen (1384), and Frankfurt (1393).
In many towns in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Advent is usually ushered in with the opening of the Christmas market or ""Weihnachtsmarkt"". In southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria, it is called a ""Christkind(e)l(s)(i)markt"" (German language, literally meaning ""Christ child market""). Traditionally held in the town square, the market offers food, drinks and seasonal items for sale from open-air stalls, accompanied by traditional singing and dancing. On opening night at the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, and in some other towns, onlookers welcome the ""Christkind"" (originally boy Jesus, but often depicted as an angel-like girl), acted by a local child.

History
The first traces of Christmas markets in the German-speaking part of Europe and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire go back to late medieval sales fairs and—often one-day—markets, which gave citizens the opportunity to stock up on meat and winter necessities at the beginning of the cold season. In 1296, Duke Albert I of Austria granted the Viennese traders the privilege of holding a ""December market"" to supply the local population.
In the 14th century, the custom arose of allowing craftsmen such as toy makers, basket weavers and confectioners to set up stalls under the name ""Saint Nicholas market"" to sell the little things that children received as Christmas gifts. There were also stands selling roasted chestnuts, nuts and almonds. A Saint Nicholas market in Munich was first mentioned in a document in 1310. In 1384, King Wenceslas granted the town of Bautzen the right to hold a free meat market on Saturdays from St. Michael's Day (29 September) until Christmas.
Over time, the tradition spread throughout the German-speaking world. The first document reporting a Christmas market is dated 1434 during the reign of Frederick II of Saxony, mentioning a Striezelmarkt, which took place in Dresden on the Monday before Christmas. Later, the Reformation continued the tradition by renaming it Christkindlmarkt (""Christ Child market"") to combat the cult of saints. The Strasbourg Christmas market dates from 1570, that of Nuremberg from 1628.
In the 19th century, the Christkindelsmärik (in Alsatian) of Strasbourg was held at the Frohnhof (French: Cour aux Corvées) between the Cathedral of Our Lady, the Palais Rohan and the Œuvre Notre-Dame Museum (current Place du Château) and took place eight days before Christmas and until midnight mass.
Since around the first half of the 20th century, markets have become an integral element of pre-Christmas customs. A revival took place in the mid-1990s. Many cities in Europe have established their own Christmas market with chalets and sometimes attractions (ephemeral ice rink, Ferris wheel, etc.), thus offering a more commercial market.

Attractions and stalls
Popular attractions at the markets include the Nativity Scene (a crèche or crib), Zwetschgenmännle (figures made of decorated dried plums), Nussknacker (carved Nutcrackers), Gebrannte Mandeln (candied, toasted almonds), traditional Christmas cookies such as Lebkuchen and Magenbrot (both forms of soft gingerbread), Bratwurst, and Glühwein, hot mulled wine (with or without a shot of brandy), or Eierpunsch (an egg-based warm alcoholic drink) -  both a highlight of the market for many visitors. Both help stave off the cold winter air which sometimes dips below freezing. More regional food specialties include Christstollen (Stollen), a sort of bread with candied fruit in Saxony, and hot Apfelwein and Frankfurter Bethmännchen in Hesse.

Major Christmas markets
Austria
Christmas markets are popular traditions in Austria, and are held in Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Linz, and Graz. The first ""December Market"" was held in Vienna in 1298. Vienna holds 20 different Christmas markets around the city. Most Christmas markets open in late November and last through December, closing right after 25 December, with a few staying open for New Year's. The largest Christmas market and one of the most well known is the Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz, near the Rathaus, Vienna's historic city hall. The market draws 3 million people each year and includes 150 unique stalls that offer traditional Austrian foods, Christmas decorations and ornaments, handicrafts, and drinks. The Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz also features an advent theme park called the Adventzauber with workshops and cultural performances that cater to families and young children. Visitors to the Vienna Christmas World can also ice skate on a 3,000-square-metre (32,000 sq ft) ice rink and on frozen paths that run through the Rathausplatz Park.
Other famous Christmas markets include the Christmas Market at Schönbrunn Palace, the Art Advent on Karlsplatz, the Christmas Village at Belvedere Palace, and the Christmas Village on Maria-Theresien-Platz. The Christmas Market at Schönbrunn Palace, “Kultur-und-Weihnachtsmarkt,” takes place in front of the imperial palace. It features Austrian handicrafts and goods as well as a cultural program with activities and workshops. The Art Advent on Karlsplatz offers artisan goods, a children's program, and a petting zoo. Popular food specialities include Kinderpunsch (a non-alcoholic punch), Glühwein, Baumstriezel (a Hungarian pastry coated in cinnamon and sugar), Kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes), Lángos (savory deep fried dough), Schaumkuss (chocolate covered marshmallows), Stollen (bread with candied fruit), Maroni (roasted chestnuts), Bratkartoffel (roasted potato wedges), Lebkuchen (Austrian gingerbread), and baked potatoes.

France
Christmas markets are traditional in Alsace, France, and most of the towns there have their local Christmas market. Strasbourg has been holding a Christmas market, ""Christkindelsmärik,"" around its cathedral since 1570, when the city was part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.

Germany
Famous Christmas markets are held in the cities of Augsburg, Dresden, Erfurt, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and Stuttgart, making them popular tourist attractions during the Christmas holiday season.  The Nuremberg and Dresden markets draw about two million people each year; the Stuttgart and Frankfurt markets attract more than three million visitors.
The two most visited Christmas markets in Germany are found in Dortmund, with more than three and a half million visitors of 300 stalls around a gigantic Christmas tree that stands 45 metres (148 ft) tall, and in Cologne with 4 million people. Additionally, Berlin claims more than 70 markets, which open in late November and close just after Christmas.

Italy
In Italy, the oldest Christmas market is considered to be that of Bologna, held for the first time in the 18th century and linked to the feast of Saint Lucia. The tradition of the markets has however spread in Italy predominantly especially since the 1990s, with the birth of the first modern markets: among these, the first ever was that of Bolzano, born in 1991, which was followed by others in the area of Alto Adige, in particular in Merano, Bressanone, Vipiteno and Brunico.
The Trento Christmas market, established in 1993, is renowned in Trentino. In Naples, where the tradition of the Neapolitan nativity scene has been famous for centuries, the exhibition of the nativity scenes made in the city's artisan shops is held every year in via San Gregorio Armeno. Noteworthy are the Christmas markets at Piazza Navona in Rome, in Verona, in Gubbio, in Alberobello, in Aosta, in Torino, in Asti, in Arezzo, in Florence, in Trieste, in Livigno, in Santa Maria Maggiore, Arco and in Cison di Valmarino.

United Kingdom
In 1982, Lincoln, England, established an annual Christmas market in early December. This remains one of the most extensive such market by area in the United Kingdom, with a claimed total of over 300 stalls attracting more than 100,000 visitors over its four days. Starting in 1997, Frankfurt Christmas Markets were established with support from Frankfurt in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds, and Manchester. Other large Christmas markets have been held in England in Bath (since 2000) and Liverpool (since 2006). The Christmas markets are such a success that they are becoming a major pull factor to increase trade and visitor numbers to towns and cities.
Birmingham's Christmas Market, primarily located on New Street between the Bullring shopping centre and the Council House, is the ""largest outdoor Christmas market in the UK"" as well as the ""largest authentic German Christmas market outside of Germany or Austria"". The market also offers live entertainment on the main stage. The market is held for approximately six weeks every year and usually closes around 23 December. Manchester's Christmas Markets have also been successful, with 300 stalls over eight city locations, with each location being themed to create a different atmosphere such as French, World, and German, with European-themed stalls on the Albert Square, Manchester proving to be the most popular.

United States
German immigrants carried Christmas market celebrations to the United States. It is celebrated in such cities as Chicago, Denver, and Tulsa.

Other countries
As noted, other countries have also established such markets. The Christmas market of Barcelona starts on 13 December, Saint Lucy's Day, and is called Fira de Santa Llúcia. It has been held in the square of Barcelona Cathedral since 1786.
A traditional Christmas market was held for the first time in Sibiu, Romania, in 2007.

Queer Christmas markets
This new, non-traditional type was inaugurated with the Munich ""Pink Christmas Market"" in 2005. Subsequently the idea spread out through other German cities (such as Berlin and Hamburg) and worldwide (e.g. in Greater Vancouver, the ""Fraser Valley Queer Christmas Market"").

39,Tallinn Christmas Market,"Tallinn Christmas Market (Estonian: Tallinna Jõuluturg) is a Christmas market held every year in Tallinn, Estonia. The modern market was founded in 2001 by Paul Oberschneider, and is open from Christmas Day until Epiphany. The latter also marks the end of the Christmas season according to the Gregorian calendar. The market brings tourists from all over the world to Tallinn.
This is traditionally held on the old Town Hall Square. Christmas cabins and stands sell handcrafts, hot wine and souvenirs to about 200,000 visitors every year.

Historical Relevance
Tallinn is the oldest capital city in Northern Europe and has one of the best preserved medieval town centres in the world. The first Christmas tree at Tallinn’s Town Hall Square was erected in 1441 by the Brotherhood of Blackheads; this was the first public Christmas Tree ever put on display in Europe.
The Brotherhood of the Blackheads, as a guild for unmarried merchants, first erected the tree for the holiday period in their brotherhood house. On the last night of celebrations the tree was taken to the Town Hall square where the members of the brotherhood danced around it before setting it on fire.

40,"Christkindelsmärik, Strasbourg","Christkindelsmärik (Alsatian dialect meaning ""Market of the Christ Child"") is a Christmas market held annually in Strasbourg, France, on the Grande Île, near Strasbourg Cathedral and the Place Kléber. It draws in approximately 2 million visitors each year and since the arrival of TGV service in Strasbourg in 2007, the number of visitors has been on the rise. Hotels can be booked a year in advance and some receive between 15 and 17% of their yearly income thanks to the Christkindelsmärik's visitors. It is considered one of the most famous Christmas markets throughout Europe. It is estimated that the city benefits of a 16 million Euros profit from this 38-day-long tradition. It is mostly famous for its fragrance of mulled wine (French: vin chaud; German: Glühwein).

History
Strasbourg has been holding Christkindelsmärik around its cathedral since 1570, making it one of the oldest Christmas markets in Europe. 
The name ""Christkindelsmärik"" is of Alsatian origin, a low Alemannic German dialect which was the mainly spoken language in the Alsace until the 20th century. In many parts of south Germany and Austria christmas markets (German: Weihnachtsmärkte) are also called Christkind(e)l(s)markt (the spelling depends on the local dialect).
The market takes place annually, from 29 November to 31 December. It mainly takes place on Place Kléber, Place Broglie, Place du Marché aux cochons de lait and around the cathedral.

Planned bomb attack
There was an Al-Qaeda plan to bomb the Christmas market at the foot of the cathedral during the Christmas celebrations of 2000. This was discovered and foiled by authorities in December 2000.

Shooting attack
On 11 December 2018, a shooting and stabbing attack occurred at the Christmas market, killing five and injuring several. The attacker, Cherif Chekatt, was injured during a shootout with French soldiers during Opération Sentinelle near the scene and shot dead by police in Strasbourg on 13 December. The incident was classified as terrorism by authorities, who identified the shooter as a known extremist who had been tagged with a fiche ""S"" (S file or security file), the highest warning level for French state security.

The tree
The Christkindelsmärik's Christmas tree, on Place Kléber, is traditionally of imposing height. Topping at 32.5 m (107 ft), the 2010 tree dwarfed much of its surroundings. The trees of the following years were only slightly less conspicuous: 30 m (98 ft) in 2011, 2015, and in 2018; 31 m (102 ft) in 2013, etc. At 35 m (115 ft), the 2019 tree surpassed even its 2010 counterpart.

41,Marketplace,"A marketplace, market place or just market is a location where people regularly gather for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other goods. In different parts of the world, a marketplace may be described as a souk (from the Arabic), bazaar (from the Persian), a fixed mercado (Spanish), or itinerant tianguis (Mexico), or palengke (Philippines). Some markets operate daily and are said to be permanent markets while others are held once a week or on less frequent specified days such as festival days and are said to be periodic markets. The form that a market adopts depends on its locality's population, culture, ambient and geographic conditions. The term market covers many types of trading, as market squares, market halls and food halls, and their different varieties. Thus marketplaces can be both outdoors and indoors, and in the modern world, online marketplaces.
Markets have existed for as long as humans have engaged in trade. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar. Middle Eastern bazaars were typically long strips with stalls on either side and a covered roof designed to protect traders and purchasers from the fierce sun. In Europe, informal, unregulated markets gradually made way for a system of formal, chartered markets from the 12th century. Throughout the medieval period, increased regulation of marketplace practices, especially weights and measures, gave consumers confidence in the quality of market goods and the fairness of prices. Around the globe, markets have evolved in different ways depending on local ambient conditions, especially weather, tradition, and culture. In the Middle East, markets tend to be covered, to protect traders and shoppers from the sun. In milder climates, markets are often open air. In Asia, a system of morning markets trading in fresh produce and night markets trading in non-perishables is common.
Today, markets can also be accessed electronically or on the internet through e-commerce or matching platforms. In many countries, shopping at a local market is a standard feature of daily life. Given the market's role in ensuring food supply for a population, markets are often highly regulated by a central authority. In many places, designated market places have become listed sites of historic and architectural significance and represent part of a town's or nation's cultural assets. For these reasons, they are often popular tourist destinations.

Etymology
The term market comes from the Latin mercatus (""market place""). The earliest recorded use of the term market in English is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 963, a work that was created during the reign of Alfred the Great (r. 871–899) and subsequently distributed, copied throughout English monasteries. The exact phrase was ""Ic wille þæt markete beo in þe selue tun"", meaning ""I desire that there be a market in the same town.""

History
In prehistory
Markets have existed since ancient times. Some historians have argued that a type of market has existed since humans first began to engage in trade. Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia, the Land of Israel, Greece, Egypt and on the Arabian peninsula. However, not all societies developed a system of markets. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that markets did not evolve in ancient Persia.
Across the Mediterranean and Aegean, a network of markets emerged from the early Bronze Age. A vast array of goods were traded, including: salt, lapis lazuli, dyes, cloth, metals, pots, ceramics, statues, spears and other implements. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age traders segmented trade routes according to geographical circuits. Both produce and ideas travelled along these trade routes.
In the Middle East, documentary sources suggest that a form of bazaar first developed around 3000 BCE. Early bazaars occupied a series of alleys along the length of the city, typically stretching from one city gate to a different gate on the other side of the city. The bazaar at Tabriz, for example, stretches along 1.5 kilometres of street and is the longest vaulted bazaar in the world. Moosavi argues that the Middle Eastern bazaar evolved in a linear pattern, whereas the market places of the West were more centralised. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures, and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remained at home weaving cloth. He also described the Babylonian marriage market, an account which inspired an 1875 painting by Edwin Long.

In antiquity
In antiquity, markets were typically situated in the town's centre. The market was surrounded by alleyways inhabited by skilled artisans, such as metal-workers, leather workers and carpenters. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.
Across ancient Greece, market places were to be found in most city states, where they operated within the agora (open space). Between 550 and 350 BCE, Greek stallholders clustered together according to the type of goods carried – fish-sellers were in one place, clothing in another, and sellers of more expensive goods such as perfumes, bottles and jars were located in a separate building. The Greeks organised trade into separate zones, all located near the city centre and known as stoa. A freestanding colonnade with a covered walkway, the stoa was both a place of commerce and a public promenade, situated within or adjacent to the agora. At the agora in Athens, officials were employed by the government to oversee weights, measures, and coinage to ensure that the people were not cheated in market place transactions. The rocky and mountainous terrain in Greece made it difficult for producers to transport goods or surpluses to local markets, giving rise to the kapēlos, a specialised type of retailer who operated as an intermediary purchasing produce from farmers and transporting it over short distances to the city markets.
In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. Rome had two forums: the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. Trajan's Market at Trajan's forum, built around 100–110 CE,  was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shopfront. In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace. In the Roman world, the central market primarily served the local peasantry. Market stall holders were primarily local primary producers who sold small surpluses from their individual farming activities and also artisans who sold leather goods, metalware and pottery. Consumers were made up of several different groups; farmers who purchased minor farm equipment and a few luxuries for their homes and urban dwellers who purchased basic necessities. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved importing and exporting. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies. 

At Pompeii, multiple markets served the population of approximately 12,000. Produce markets were located in the vicinity of the Forum, while livestock markets were situated on the city's perimeter, near the amphitheatre. A long narrow building at the north-west corner of the Forum was some type of market, possibly a cereal market. On the opposite corner stood the macellum, thought to have been a meat and fish market. Market stall-holders paid a market tax for the right to trade on market days. Some archaeological evidence suggests that markets and street vendors were controlled by local government. A graffito on the outside of a large shop documents a seven-day cycle of markets: ""Saturn's day at Pompeii and Nuceria, Sun's day at Atella and Nola, Moon's day at Cumae"", etc. The presence of an official commercial calendar suggests something of the market's importance to community life and trade. Markets were also important centres of social life.

In medieval Europe
In early Western Europe, markets developed close to monasteries, castles or royal residences. Priories and aristocratic manorial households created considerable demand for goods and services, both luxuries and necessities, and also afforded some protection to merchants and traders. These centres of trade attracted sellers which would stimulate the growth of the town. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists 50 markets in England; however, many historians believe this figure underestimates the actual number of markets in operation at the time. In England, some 2,000 new markets were established between 1200 and 1349. By 1516, England had some 2,464 markets and 2,767 fairs, while Wales had 138 markets and 166 fairs.
From the 12th century, English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter protected the town's trading privileges in return for an annual fee. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Fairs, which were usually held annually, and almost always associated with a religious festival, traded in high value goods, while regular weekly or bi-weekly markets primarily traded in fresh produce and necessities. Although a fair's primary purpose was trade, it typically included some elements of entertainment, such as dance, music or tournaments. As the number of markets increased, market towns situated themselves sufficiently far apart so as to avoid competition, but close enough to permit local producers a round trip within one day (about 10 km). Some British open-air markets have been operating continuously since the 12th century.

A pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was probably established in Italy with the open loggias of Mercato Nuovo (1547) designed and constructed by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the Medici family); Mercato Vecchio, Florence, designed by Giorgio Vasari (1567); and Loggia del Grano (1619) by Giulio Parigi.
Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Over time, permanent shops began opening daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets, while peddlers or itinerant sellers continued to fill in any gaps in distribution.
During the Middle Ages, the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange. Shops had higher overhead costs, but were able to offer regular trading hours and a relationship with customers and may have offered added value services, such as credit terms to reliable customers. The economy was primarily characterised by local trading in which goods were traded across relatively short distances.
Beach markets, which were known in north-western Europe, during the Viking period, were primarily associated with the sale of fish. From around the 11th century, the number and variety of imported goods sold at beach markets began to increase. giving consumers access to a broader range of exotic and luxury goods. Throughout the Medieval period, markets became more international. The historian, Braudel, reports that, in 1600, grain moved just 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. However, following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar – calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.

Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as the consumer's perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. Such considerations informed decisions about where to make purchases and which markets to patronise.
As the number of charters granted increased, competition between market towns also increased. In response to competitive pressures, towns invested in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors such as covered accommodation. By the thirteenth century, counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's Blackwell Hall became a centre for cloth, Bristol became associated with a particular type of cloth known as Bristol red, Stroud was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of Worsted became synonymous with a type of yarn; Banbury and Essex were strongly associated with cheeses.
In the market economy, goods are ungraded and unbranded, so that consumers have relatively few opportunities to evaluate quality prior to consumption. Consequently, supervision of weights, measures, food quality and prices was a key consideration. In medieval society, regulations for such matters appeared initially at the local level. The Charter of Worcester, written between 884 and 901 provided for fines for dishonest trading, amongst other things. Such local regulations were codified in 13th century England in what became known as the Statute of Winchester. This document outlined the assizes for 16 different trades, most of which were associated with markets – miller, baker, fisher, brewer, inn-keeper, tallow-chandler, weaver, cordwainer etc. For each trade, regulations covered such issues as fraud, prices, quality, weights and measures and so on. The assize was a formal codification of prior informal codes which had been practised for many years. The courts of assize were granted the power to enforce these regulations. The process of standardizing quality, prices and measures assisted markets to gain the confidence of buyers and made them more attractive to the public.
A sixteenth century commentator, John Leland, described particular markets as ""celebrate"", ""very good"" and ""quik"", and, conversely, as ""poore"", ""meane"", and ""of no price"". Over time, some products became associated with particular places, providing customers with valuable information about the types of goods, their quality and their region of origin. In this way, markets helped to provide an early form of product branding. Gradually, certain market towns earned a reputation for providing quality produce. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic chartered markets. The 18th century commentator Daniel Defoe visited Sturbridge fair in 1723 and wrote a lengthy description which paints a picture of a highly organised, vibrant operation which attracted large number of visitors from some distance away. ""As for the people in the fair, they all universally eat, drink and sleep in their booths, and tents; and the said booths are so intermingled with taverns, coffee-houses, drinking-houses, eating-houses, cookshops &c, and all tents too, and so many butchers and higglers from all the neighbouring counties come in to the fair every morning, with beef, mutton, fowls, bread, cheese, eggs and such things; and go with them from tent to tent and from door to door, that there is no want of provision of any kind, either dress'd or undress'd.""

In Asia Minor
In the Asia Minor, prior to the 10th century, market places were situated on the perimeter of the city. Along established trade routes, markets were most often associated with the caravanserai typically situated just outside the city walls. However, when the marketplace began to become integrated into city structures, it was transformed into a covered area where traders could buy and sell with some protection from the elements. Markets at Mecca and Medina were known to be significant trade centres in the 3rd century (CE) and the nomadic communities were highly dependent on them for both trade and social interactions. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously operating, purpose-built market; its construction began in 1455.

In Asia
Dating the emergence of marketplaces in China is difficult. According to tradition, the first market was established by the legendary Shennongan or the ""Divine Farmer"" who arranged for markets to be held at midday. In other ancient sayings, markets originally developed around wells in the town or village centre. Scholars, however, question the reliability of traditional narratives unless backed by archaeological evidence.
The earliest written references to markets dates to the time of Qi Huanggong (ruled 685 to 643 BCE). Qi's Prime Minister, the great reformer, Guan Zhong, divided the capital into 21 districts (xiang) of which three were dedicated to farmers, three to hand-workers and three to businessmen, who were instructed to settle near the markets. Some of these early markets have been the subject of archaeological surveys. For instance, the market at Yong, the capital of the Qi state, measured 3,000 square metres and was an outdoor market.
According to the Rites of Zhou, markets were highly organized and served different groups at different times of day; merchants at the morning market, every day people at the afternoon market and peddlers at the evening market. The marketplace also became the place were executions were carried out, rewards were published and decrees were read out.
During the Qin empire and the Han dynasty which followed it, markets were enclosed with walls and gates and strictly separated from residential areas. Vendors were arranged according to the type of commodity offered, and markets were strictly regulated with departments responsible for security, weights and measures, price-fixing and certificates.
Over time, specialised markets began to emerge. In Luoyang, during the Tang Dynasty, a metal market was known. Outside the city walls were sheep and horse markets. Marco Polo's account of 13th century markets specifically mentions a silk market. He was also impressed by the size of markets. According to his account, the ten markets of Hangzhou, primarily a fish market, attracted 40,000 to 50,000 patrons on each of its three trading days each week.
In China, negative attitudes towards mercantile activity developed; merchants were the lowest class of society. High officials carefully distanced themselves from merchant classes. In 627, an edict prohibited those of rank five or higher from entering markets. One anecdote from the time of Empress Wu relates the tale of a fourth rank official who missed out on the opportunity for promotion after he was seen purchasing a steamed pancake from a market.

In Mesoamerica
In Mesoamerica, a tiered system of traders developed independently. Extensive trade networks predated the Aztec empire by at least hundreds of years. Local markets where people purchased their daily necessities were known as tianguis, while a pochteca was a professional merchant who travelled long distances to obtain rare goods or luxury items desired by the nobility. The system supported various levels of pochteca – from very high status through to minor traders who acted as a type of peddler to fill in gaps in the distribution system. Colonial sources also record Mayan market hubs at Acalan, Champotón, Chetumal, Bacalar, Cachi, Conil, Pole, Cozumel, Cochuah, Chauaca, Chichén Itzá as well as markets marking the edges of Yucatecan canoe trade such as Xicalanco and Ulua. The Spanish conquerors commented on the impressive nature of the local markets in the 15th century. The Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas and said to be superior to those in Europe.

Types
There are many different ways to classify markets. One way is to consider the nature of the buyer and the market's place within the distribution system. This leads to two broad classes of market, namely retail market or wholesale markets. The economist, Alfred Marshall classified markets according to time period. In this classification, there are three types of market; the very short period market where the supply of a commodity remains fixed.  Perishables, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish fall into this group since goods must be sold within a few days and the quantity supplied is relatively inelastic. The second group is the short period market where the time in which the quantity supplied can be increased by improving the scale of production (adding labor and other inputs but not by adding capital). Many non-perishable goods fall into this category. The third category is the long-period market where the length of time can be improved by capital investment.
Other ways to classify markets include its trading area (local, national or international); its physical format or its produce.
Major physical formats of markets are:

Bazaar: typically a covered market in the Middle East
Car boot sale: a type of market where people come together to trade household and garden goods; very popular in the United Kingdom
Dry market: a market selling durable goods such as fabric and electronics, as distinguished from ""wet markets""
E-commerce: an online marketplace for consumer products which can be sold anywhere in the world
Indoor market of any sort
Marketplace: an open space where a market is or was formerly held in a town
Market square in Europe: open area usually in town centre with stalls selling goods in a public square
Public market in the United States: an indoor, fixed market in a building and selling a variety of goods
Street market: a public street with stalls along one or more sides of the street
Floating market: where goods are sold from boats, chiefly found in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam
Night market: popular in many countries in Asia, opening at night and featuring much street food and a more leisurely shopping experience. In Indonesia and Malaysia they are known as pasar malam
Wet market (also known as a public market): a market selling fresh meat, fish, produce, and other perishable goods as distinguished from ""dry markets""
Markets may feature a range of merchandise for sale, or they may be one of many specialist markets, such as:

Animal markets (i.e. livestock markets)
Antique markets
Farmers' markets, focusing on fresh produce and gourmet food lines (preserves, chutneys, relishes, cheeses etc.) prepared from farm produce
Fish markets
Flea markets or swap meets, a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items at low prices are commonplace
Flower markets, such as the Mercado Jamaica in Mexico City and the Bloemenmarkt in Amsterdam
Food halls, featuring gourmet food to consume on- and off-premises, such as those at Harrods (London) and Galeries Lafayette (Paris) department stores. In North America, these may be also referred to simply as ""markets"" (or ""mercados"" in Spanish), such as the West Side Market in Cleveland, Ponce City Market in Atlanta, and the Mercado Roma in Mexico City.
Grey market: where second hand or recycled goods are sold (sometimes termed a green market)
Handicraft markets
Markets selling items used in the occult (for magic, by witches, etc.)
Supermarkets and hypermarkets

In literature and art
Markets generally have featured prominently in artworks, especially amongst the Dutch painters of Antwerp from the middle of the 16th century. Pieter Aertsen was known as the ""great painter of the market"". Both he and his nephew, Joachim Beuckelaer, painted market scenes, street vendors and merchants extensively. Elizabeth Honig argues that painters' interest in markets was in part due to the changing nature of the market system at that time. The public began to distinguish between two types of merchant, the meerseniers which referred to local merchants including bakers, grocers, sellers of dairy products and stall-holders, and the koopman, which described a new, emergent class of trader who dealt in goods or credit on a large scale. With the rise of a European merchant class, this distinction was necessary to separate the daily trade that the general population understood from the rising ranks of traders who operated on a world stage and were seen as quite distant from everyday experience.
During the 17th and 18th centuries, as Europeans conquered parts of North Africa and the Levant, European artists began to visit the Orient and painted scenes of everyday life. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other.  Europeans often saw Orientals as the photographic negative of Western civilisation; the peoples could be threatening – they were ""despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational"". At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. Artists focussed on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets and bazaars, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favourite subject matter, and the high vaulted market places features in numerous paintings and sketches.
Individual markets have also attracted literary attention. Les Halles was known as the ""Belly of Paris"", and was so named by author, Émile Zola in his novel Le Ventre de Paris, which is set in the busy 19th century marketplace of central Paris. Les Halles, a complex of market pavilions in Paris, features extensively in both literature and painting. Giuseppe Canella (1788 - 1847) painted Les Halles et la rue de la Tonnellerie. Photographer, Henri Lemoine (1848–1924), also photographed Les Halles de Paris.

Around the world
Africa
Markets have been known in parts of Africa for centuries. An 18th century commentator noted the many markets he visited in West Africa. He provided a detailed description of market activities at Sabi, in the Wydah (now the part of the Republic of Benin): 

Their fairs and markets are regulated with so much care and prudence, that nothing contrary to law is ever committed. All sorts of merchandise here are collected, and those who have brought goods are permitted to take what time they please to dispose of them, but without fraud or noise. A judge, attended by four officers armed, is appointed by the King for the inspection of goods, to hear and determine all grievances, complaints and disputes ... The market place is surrounded by butlers and booths, and places of refreshment for the conveniency of the people. They are only permitted to sell certain sorts of meats, pork, goats, beef and dog flesh. Other booths are kept by women who sell maize, millet, rice and corn bread. Other shops sell Pito, a sort of pleasant and wholesome, and very refreshing beer. Palm wine, acqua vita and spirits which they get from the Europeans, are kept in other shops, with restrictions on sale to prevent drunkenness and riots. Here slaves of both sexes are bought and sold, also oxen, sheep, dogs, hogs, shish and birds of all kind. Woollen cloths, linen, silks and calicoes of European and Indian manufacture, they have it in great abundance, likewise hard-ware, china and glass of all sorts; gold in dust and ingots, iron in bars, lead in sheets and everything of European, Asiatic or African production is here found at reasonable prices.
In the Kingdom of Benin (modern Benin City), he commented on the exotic foods available for sale at a market there:

Besides the dry merchandise of which the markets of Benin abound, they are also well stocked with eatables, a little particular in kind. Here they expose dogs to sale for eating, of which the negroes are very fond. Roasted monkeys, apes and baboons are every where to be seen. Bats, rats and lizards dried in the sun, palm wine and fruit, form the must luxurious entertainments, and stand continually for sale in the streets.

Botswana
In Botswana, the sale of agricultural produce to the formal market is largely controlled by large corporations. Most small, local farmers sell their produce to the informal market, local communities and street vendors. The main wholesale market is the Horticultural market in Gaborone. The government made some attempts to build markets in the north of the country, but that was largely unsuccessful and most commercial buyers travel to Johannesburg or Tshwane for supplies.

Ethiopia
Ethiopia is a major producer and exporter of grains and a number of wholesale markets assist with the distribution and export of such products. Important wholesale markets include: Nekemte in the East Welega zone, Jimma in the Jimma zone, Assela and Sagure in the Arsi zone, Bahir Dar and Bure in the Gojjam zone, Dessie and Kombolcha in the Wollo zone, Mekele in the Tigray region, Dire Dawa and Harar in the Oromia region, and Addis Ababa. Some of the major retail markets in Ethiopia include: Addis Mercato in Addis Ababa, the largest open air market in the country; Gulalle and Galan, both in Addis Ababa; Awasa Lake Fish Market in Awasa, the Saturday market Harar, and the Saturday market in Axum.

Ghana
Ghanaian markets have survived in spite of sometimes brutal measures to eradicate them. In the late 1970s, the Ghanaian government used market traders as a scapegoat for its own policy failures which involved food shortages and high inflation. The government blamed traders for failing to observe pricing guidelines and vilified ""women merchants"". In 1979, the Makola market was dynamited and bulldozed, but within a week the traders were back selling fruit, vegetables and fish, albeit without a roof over their head.

Kenya
Kenya's capital, Nairobi, has several major markets. Wakulima market is one of the region's largest markets, situated on Haile Selassie Avenue in Nairobi. Other markets in Nairobi are: Kariakor Market, Gikomba Market, and Muthurwa Market. In Mombasa, Kongowea market is also a very large market with over 1500 stalls and covering 4.5 ha.

Morocco
In Morocco, markets are known as souks, and are normally found in a city's Medina (old city or old quarter).  Shopping at a produce market is a standard feature of daily life in Morocco. In the larger cities, Medinas are typically made up of a collection of souks built amid a maze of narrow streets and laneways where independent vendors and artisans tend to cluster in sections which subsequently become known for a particular type of produce – such as the silversmith's street or the textile district. In Tangiers, a sprawling market fills the many streets of the medina and this area is divided into two sections, known as the Grand Socco and the Petit Socco. The term 'socco' is a Spanish corruption of the Arabic word for souk, meaning marketplace. These markets sell a large variety of goods: fresh produce, cooking equipment, pottery, silverware, rugs and carpets, leather goods, clothing, accessories, electronics, alongside cafes, restaurants and take-away food stalls. The medina at Fez is the oldest, having been founded in the 9th century. The medina at Fez has been named a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today it is the main fresh produce market and is noted for its narrow laneways and for a total ban on motorized traffic. All produce is brought in and out of the marketplace by donkey or hand-cart. In Marrakesh, the main produce markets are also to be found in the medina and a colourful market is also held daily in the Jemaa el-Fnaa (main square) where roaming performers and musicians entertain the large crowds that gather there. Marrakesh has the largest traditional Berber market in Morocco.

Namibia
Namibia has been almost entirely dependent on South Africa for its fresh produce. Dominated by rolling plains and long sand dunes and an unpredictable rainfall, many parts of Namibia are unsuited to growing fruit and vegetables. Government sponsored initiatives have encouraged producers to grow fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes and grains The Namibian Ministry of Agriculture has recently launched a system of fresh produce hubs to serve as a platform for producers to market and distribute their produce. It is anticipated that these hubs will assist in curbing the number of sellers who take their produce to South Africa where it is placed on cold storage, only to be imported back into the country at a later date.

Nigeria
South Africa
Fresh produce markets have traditionally dominated the South African food chain, handling more than half of all fresh produce. Although large, vertically integrated food retailers, such as supermarkets, are beginning to make inroads into the supply chain, traditional hawkers and produce markets have shown remarkable resilience. The main markets in Johannesburg are: Jozi Real Food Market, Bryanston Organic Market, Pretoria Boeremark specialising in South African delicacies, Hazel Food Market, Panorama Flea Market, Rosebank Sunday Market, Market on Main –(a periodic arts market), and neighbourhood markets.

The Gambia
The ""Gambia is Good"" initiative was established in 2004 with a view to encouraging a market for locally grown fresh produce rather than imported ones. The plan was designed to ""stimulate local livelihoods, inspire entrepreneurship and reduce the environmental and social cost of imported produce"".
A great deal of the produce trade is carried out informally on street corners and many shops are little more than market booths. However, dedicated open air and covered markets can be found in the larger towns. Notable markets include: the Serekunda Market in Gambia's largest city, Serekunda, which opens from early morning to late at night 7 days a week and trades in produce, live animals, clothing, accessories, jewellery, crafts, second hand goods and souvenirs; The Albert Market in the capital, Banjul, which sells fresh produce, colourful, locally designed fabrics, musical instruments, carved wooden masks and other local products. Other interesting markets include: Bakau Fish Market in Bakau; Tanji Fish Market, Tanji, where brightly painted fishing boats bring in the fish from where it is immediately preserved using traditional methods and prepared for distribution to other West African countries; The Woodcarvers Market in Brikama which boasts the largest concentration of woodcarvers in the country; the Pottery Market in Basse Santa; the Atlantic Road Craft Market at Bakau and the Senegambia Craft Market at Bakau.

Uganda
Nakawa Market

Asia
Produce markets in Asia are undergoing major changes as supermarkets enter the retail scene and the growing middle classes acquire preferences for branded goods. Many supermarkets purchase directly from producers, supplanting the traditional role of both wholesale and retail markets. In order to survive, produce markets have been forced to consider value adding opportunities and many retail markets now focus on ready-to-eat food and take-away food.

East Asia
China
In China, the existence of street and wet markets has been known for centuries; however, many of these were restricted in the 1950s and 1960s and only permitted to re-open in 1978. The distinction between wholesale and retail markets is somewhat ambiguous in China, since many markets serve both as distribution centres and retail shopping venues. To assist in the distribution of food, more than 9,000 wholesale produce markets operate in China. Some of these markets operate on a very large scale. For example, Beijing's Xinfadi Wholesale market, currently under renovation, is expected to have a footprint of 112 hectares when complete. The Beijing Zoo Market (retail market) is a collection of 12 different markets, comprising some 20,000 tenant stall-holders, 30,000 employees and more than 100,000 customers daily.
China is both a major importer and exporter of fruit and vegetables and is now the world's largest exporter of apples. In addition to produce markets, China has many specialised markets such as a silk market, clothing markets and an antiques market. China's fresh produce market is undergoing major change. In the larger cities, purchasing is gradually moving to online with door-to-door deliveries.
Some of the more important markets in China include: 

Wholesale produce market: Xinfadi (wholesale produce market, Beijing)  - with an annual turnover volume of 14 million tonnes of meat, fruit and vegetables, it supplies 70 percent of Beijing's vegetables and Nanzhan (Shenyang, Liaoning) which supplies the northern provinces.
Retail produce markets: The fresh produce market at Hutong market (Beijing); Xiabu Xiabu market (Beijing), Panjiayuan market (Beijing); Dazhongsi market (Beijing), Tianyi market (Beijing), Beijing Zoo market, Dahongmen market (Fengtai District, Beijing), Sanyuanli market (Beijing), Shengfu Xiaoguan morning market (Beijing), Lishuiqiao seafood farmers' market (Beijing), Wangjing Zonghe market (Beijing), Chaowai market (Beijing), Zhenbai market (Shanghai's largest produce market)

Hong Kong
Hong Kong relies heavily imports to meet its fresh produce needs. Importers are consequently an important part of the distribution network, and some importers supply directly to retail consumers. Street markets in Hong Kong are held every day except on a few traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year. Stalls opened at two sides of a street are required to have licenses issued by the Hong Kong Government. The various types of street markets include fresh foods, clothing, cooked foods, flowers and electronics. The earliest form of market was a gaa si (wet market). Some traditional markets have been replaced by shopping centres, markets in municipal service buildings and supermarkets, while others have become tourist attractions such as Tung Choi Street and Apliu Street. The Central Market, Hong Kong is a grade II listed building.

Although the majority of markets in South Korea are wholesale markets, retail customers are permitted to make purchases in all of them. The Gwangjang Market is the nation's top market and is a popular tourist destination.

Taiwan
Taiwan meets most of its produce needs through local production. This means that the country has a very active network of wholesale and retail markets. According to The Guardian newspaper, Taiwan has ""the best night market scene in the world and some of the most exciting street food in Asia"".

South Asia
In South Asia, especially Nepal, India and Bangladesh, a haat (also known as hat) refers to a regular rural produce market, typically held once or twice per week.

India
The marketing historian, Petty, has suggested that Indian marketplaces first arose during the Chola Dynasty (approx. 850–1279 CE) during a period of favourable economic conditions. Distinct types of markets were evident: nagaaram (streets of shops, often devoted to specific types of goods; angadi (markets) and perangadi (large markets in the inner city districts).
The sub-continent may have borrowed the concept of covered marketplaces from the Middle East around the tenth century with the arrival of Islam. The caravanserai and covered market structures, known as suqs, first began to appear along the silk routes and were located in the area just outside the city perimeter. Following the tradition established on the Arabian peninsula, India also established temporary-seasonal markets in regional districts. In Rajasthan's Pushkar, an annual camel market was first recorded in the 15th century. However, following the foundation of the Mughal Empire in northern India during the 16th century, this arrangement changed. A covered bazaar or market place became integrated into city structures and was to be found in the city centre. Markets and bazaars were well known in the colonial era. Some of these bazaars appear to have specialised in particular types of produce. The Patna district, in the 17th century, was home to 175 weaver villages and the Patna Bazaar enjoyed a reputation as a centre of trade in fine cloth. When the Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, visited there in 1863, he found many merchants trading in cotton and silk in Patna's bazaars.
In India today, many different types of market serve retail and commercial clients:

Wholesale markets
Primary wholesale markets: held once or twice per week, these sell produce from local villages e.g. Rice Bazaar at Thissur in Kerala
Secondary wholesale markets (also known as mandis): smaller merchants purchase from primary markets and sell at secondary markets. A small number of primary producers may sell direct to mandis.
Terminal markets: Markets that sell directly to the end-user, whether it be the consumer, food processor or shipping agent for export to foreign countries e.g. Bombay Terminal Market
Retail markets
Retail markets: spread across villages, towns and cities
Fairs: held on religious days and deal in livestock and agricultural produce
In India (and also Bangladesh and Pakistan), a landa bazaar is a type of a bazaar or a marketplace with lowest prices where only secondhand general goods are exchanged or sold. A haat also refers to a bazaar or market in Bangladesh and Pakistan and the term may also be used in India. A saddar refers to the main, central market in a town while a mandi refers to a large marketplace. A Meena Bazaar is a marketplace where goods are sold in an effort to raise money for charity.

Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is noted for its night markets, floating markets and pirate markets (markets that specialise in selling ""knock off"" copies of designer brands). Some Asian countries have developed unique distribution systems and highly specialised types of market place. Throughout Asia, a wet market refers to a place where fruit, vegetables, fish, seafood and meat products are sold. Throughout much of Asia, produce markets are known as morning markets due to their hours of operation, while night markets specialise in selling non-perishables including clothing, accessories, local artefacts, souvenirs and a wide assortment of personal goods.

Indonesia
In Indonesia, a pasar pagi is a particular type of wet market, also known as a ""morning market"" which typically operates from early morning to the afternoon. Pasar malam refers to a night market operated in later hours from late afternoon to night, approximately from 17:00 to 22:00, and only on selected days of a week.
The types of goods being sold is also quite different. Pasar pagi is where many housewives, domestic help, and local folks appear to shop their daily needs, mostly fresh produce. The things which are on sale are usually fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, spices, fish, meat, eggs, and a variety of perishable products.
Major textile, fashion, and clothing markets in Indonesia are Tanah Abang market in central Jakarta and Pasar Baru in Bandung. Notable markets specializing in traditional batik clothing include Pasar Klewer in Solo and Pasar Beringharjo in Yogyakarta.
The major pasar pagi in Jakarta are Pasar Pagi Mangga Dua, Pasar Induk Kramat Jati, Pasar Minggu and Pasar Senen. Pasar Minggu specialized on fruits and vegetables, while Pasar Kue Subuh in Senen specialized on selling kue, as they offer a rich variety of traditional Indonesian snack, open every subuh (dawn).
Notable markets in Yogyakarta, include: Pasar Beringharjo, a traditional market; Kranggan Market, a flea market; Pasar Organik Milas, organic and flea market; Malioboro Road, a street market and Yogyakarta Bird Market.
Notable markets in Bali include Pasar Badung central market of Denpasar city, Pasar Seni Sukowati art market specializing in artworks and handicrafts, and Pasar Ubud.
In several cities and towns in Kalimantan and Sumatra, there are floating markets, which is a collection of vendors selling various produce and product on boats. For example, the Siring floating market in Banjarmasin, and Lok Baintan floating market in Martapura, both in South Kalimantan.

Malaysia
In Malaysia the term Pasar malam refers to a night market which operates from around 17:00 through to approximately 23:00. Pasar pagi morning wet market is also familiar in Malaysia.
In parts of Malaysia, jungle produce markets trade in indigenous fruits and vegetables, all of which are gaining popularity as consumers switch to pesticide-free food products. Some of the more nutritional indigenous produce includes fruits such as dabai (Canarium odontophyllum), kembayau (Dacryodes rostrata f. cuspidata), durian nyekak (Durio kutejensis) and durian kuning (Durio graveolens), letup (Passiflora foetida), kepayang (Pangium edule) and tubu (Pycnarrhena tumetacta) and vegetables such as tengang  (Gnetum sp.) and riang batu (Begonia chlorosticia), teh kampung  (Leucosyke capitellata and tongkat langit (Musa troglodytarum ).
The main markets in Kuala Lumpur include: Pudu market: rated as KL's largest wet market by the Lonely Planet Guide; Central Market, Kuala Lumpur; Chow Kit Wet Market; Kampong Bahru Pasar Minggu; China Town; Petaling Jaya SS2; Bangsar Baru and Lorong Tuanka Abdul Rahman.

Philippines
In the Philippines, the word palengke refers to a group of stalls under a covered roof. Locals use palengkes for daily shopping.  Public markets are the primary trading centres in cities. In rural districts, public markets are in a state of disrepair. Weekend markets are popular for organic and artisanal foods purchases. In addition, a number of farmers' markets have sprung up. The Cubao Farmers Market, in Quezon City gained international attention following a feature spot on the cable network program, No Reservations, with Anthony Bourdain in 2009.

Thailand
Bangkok
Bangkok's markets are popular with both locals and visitors. Floating markets can be found in Bangkok and elsewhere. Vendors not only sell fresh produce from boats, but will also cook meals and snacks on their vessels for sale to the public. These floating markets are a popular tourist attraction.

West Asia
In the West Asia, markets are known as bazaars or souks. The earliest bazaars are believed to have originated in Persia, and spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe from there. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of a city from around 3,000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar.
In the ancient cities of Iran, three types of bazaar have been identified; periodic bazaars, urban bazaars and local bazaars. Periodic bazaars could be organised anywhere and typically took place in open spaces and traded in specialities such as handicrafts, clothing, livestock and foodstuffs. These took place at regular intervals such as monthly or yearly. Urban bazaars were held in covered public walkways with shops or stores on both sides. Its architecture varied according to local conditions including climate, culture and the economic power of the city in which it was situated.  Urban bazaars were places for commercial, social and cultural interactions. Local bazaars, held in specific districts of larger cities, were similar to urban bazaars, but on a smaller scale with fewer shops.
In pre-Islamic Arabia, markets took on two forms, permanent urban markets and temporary, seasonal markets often located in regional districts. Gradually, markets or bazaars gradually became central features of urban towns and were relocated to the city centre. Permanent markets are mentioned frequently in ancient literary sources.

Iran
Markets in Iran with historical or architectural significance include:

Grand Bazaar, Tehran
Bazaar of Kashan in Iran
Bazaar of Isfahan in Iran – historic site which dates to Saljuqid and Safavid era and is the longest roofed market in the world.
Bazaar of Tabriz in Iran – an historic site that originally developed along the ancient silk routes; listed as a World Heritage Site
Vakil Bazaar in Shiraz, Iran

Israel
The Hebrew word for market is shuk (plural: shvakim), and food markets are found in every major city. Famous markets include the Carmel Market in Tel Aviv and Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem.

Turkey
Street markets are called pazar in Turkish and usually named after the name of the day since they are only installed at around 05:00 on that specific day and ended on same day around 18:00, in every week. Every district in Turkey has its own open market where people can choose and buy from a very wide range of products, from fresh fruits and vegetables to clothing, from traditional white cheese (which some people may consider feta-like) to household items. In Istanbul area Wednesday Pazar of Fatih district, Tuesday Pazar of Kadıköy and Friday Pazar of Ortaköy are the most famous and crowded open markets of the city.
A market with shops or permanent stalls is called çarşı and may include covered streets that are closed at night. Famous examples include the Kapalıçarşı (Grand Bazaar) and Spice Bazaar in Istanbul.

France
Paris was one of the first European cities to implement a system of formal, centralised and covered market places. Les Halles, a vast centralised wholesale market, was known to be in existence at least by the 13th century when it was expanded, and was only demolished in 1971 to make way for an underground shopping precinct. The French system of organised, designated central retail markets was extensively studied by architects in London with a view to emulating the system and ultimately eradicating the informal supply of produce via street vendors.

Background and licensing
The majority of retail markets are operated by the public sector and administered by local governments. A small number are operated by private groups or individuals. Traders can be licensed to trade on a single pitch but not at a national level or when trading on private land. This piecemeal licensing system has contributed to declining public confidence in the reputation of markets. A voluntary scheme has been set up by The Market People, backed by the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA) to address this problem. It provides consumers with traceability of traders and goods as well as the ability to rate and contact the traders. A MarketPASS is issued to an operator or trader, once they have provided proof of identity, insurance and, where required, a hygiene certificate.
A study conducted by the Retail Alliance noted that Britain had 1,124 traditional retail markets, 605 farmers' markets, 26 wholesale markets and more than 45,700 retail traders and that retail markets had an annual turnover of over £3.5 billion while wholesale markets had turnover of £4.1 billion annually. The data also shows that traditional outdoor street markets continue to dominate the market space, but are in decline. Markets also have significant appeal for tourists and visitors.
Some researchers make a distinction between traditional markets and gentrified markets. Traditional markets which are primarily held outdoors on specific days, focus on high volume produce sold with low margins. In the gentrified market, the focus is on specialty produce, notably organic foods, hyper-local produce, artisanal products, vintage clothing or designer brands. Whereas traditional markets are in decline, gentrified markets represent a major growth opportunity.

England's chartered markets and fairs
From the 11th century, the English monarchs awarded a charter to local lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. A charter granted the lords the right to take tolls from vendors and also afforded some protection to a town from rival markets. Once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. Gradually these market towns developed a reputation for quality or for trade in specific types of goods. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard these historic charters.

London
Between the 13th century and the Great Fire of 1666, London's main market was the Stocks Market, ""on the site of the fixed pillory where traders were punished who fell foul of the Assize Courts"". The Stocks Market was removed in 1737 as part of Christopher Wren's plans to rebuild the city. New wholesale markets were erected in strategic locations and these prospered until well into the 19th century with some continuing until modern times. The wholesale markets were highly controlled, closed environments that were minutely regulated and meticulously planned. These included Smithfield Meat Market (built in 1866), Billingsgate Fish Market (constructed in 1875) and Leadenhall Market (completed in 1881). The retail trade was largely serviced by itinerant street sellers or costermongers. In central London, costermongers worked along designated routes, selling door-to-door or by trading from some 36 unauthorised, but highly organised markets situated along major thoroughfares or meeting places such as Whitecross Street, Covent Garden and Leather Lane. In an attempt to regulate street trading, a number of authorised retail markets were built during the 19th century with limited success. Examples of retail markets constructed during this period include: St James, St George's (Southwark), Carnaby, Hungerford, Randall's (Poplar, London), Fitzroy, Finsbury, and the People's Market (Whitechapel), Angela Burdett-Coutts' Market and Columbia Road Market (now a flower market). Retail markets were less successful than their wholesale counterparts and the number of retail markets declined from 24 in 1800 to 17 in 1840. In reality, London's working classes generally preferred the convenience of street trading which continued to thrive until the 20th century.
Charles Knight devoted an entire section to markets in his pictorial essay, Pictorial Half-hours of London Topography, (1851) in which he identifies the main wholesale markets as the Corn Market; the Coal Exchange; Billingsgate – the main fish market; Smithfield – a cattle market since at least 1150. Retail meat markets include Newgate; Whitechapel; Newgate; Newport, Oxford; St George's and Shepherd's Market in Mayfair. Produce markets included Covent Garden, which Knight considered to be the 'pre-eminent' vegetable market; Farringdon Market between Holborn Hill and Fleet Street; Spitalfields, the largest potato market in London; Portman Market; Hungerford Market; and Leadenhall Market, a mixed produce and meat market. In addition, the Skin Market at Bermondsey dealt in leather and hay markets were held at Whitechapel, Cumberland Market, Regent's Park and Smithfield.
Some examples of street markets operating today include Berwick Street Market, Broadway Market, Camden Market, East Street Market, Petticoat Lane and Portobello Road Market. The most popular for food is Borough Market which sell most fresh produce as well as having a bakery.

Greece
Street markets in Greece are called laikes agores (λαϊκές αγορές) in plural, or laiki agora (λαϊκή αγορά) in singular, meaning ""people's market"". They are very common all over Greece, including the capital, Athens. Regular (weekly) morning markets sell mostly fresh produce from farming cooperatives – fruit, vegetables, fish and flowers/plants. Some household items and prepared foods are often available.
Annual street markets (panigyri(a)) occur around churches on the day of their patron saint. These take place in the evenings and have a more festive character, often involving attractions and food stalls. The goods sold range from clothing and accessories to household items, furniture, toys and trinkets. Athens also has several bazaars/enclosed markets.

Spain
In Spain, two types of retail market can be identified; permanent markets and periodic markets. Permanent markets are typically housed in a building dedicated to the use of stallholders and vendors. Periodic markets appear in the streets and plazas on specific days, such as weekends or festival days and most often sell products made by local artisans including leather goods, fashion accessories, especially scarves and costume jewellery. Vendors at periodic markets typically erect tents or canvas awnings to provide some type of temporary cover for themselves and shoppers. Produce markets, farmers' markets and flea markets are all commonplace. In addition, street vendors are a relatively common sight across most parts of Spain. Street vendors roam around in search of a suitable venue such as a plaza, entrance to a railway station or beach front where they lay their goods out on mats. Products sold by street vendors are of highly variable quality.

Barcelona
The first reliable recorded references to markets in Barcelona date to the 10th century. Barcelona, at that time, was a walled city and the first open-air market was held outside the walls, (in the area now known as Plaça de l'Àngel). A merchant district soon grew up around the market. During the 19th century, numerous covered markets were erected, specifically Santa Caterina Market (1844); San Josep (c. 1840), Llibertat (1875), San Antoni (1882), Barceloneta (1884), Concepció and Hostafrancs (1888), Clot and Poblenou (1889) and Abaceria in Gracia (1892).
Barcelona residents are well served by the city's 39 produce markets. Every barrio (suburb) has at least one fresh produce market. It is often said that no matter where you find yourself in Barcelona, you are never more than 10 minutes walk from a market. Barcelona's markets attract some 62 million visits yearly, turnover €950million and employ 7,500 people.
Some of the larger produce markets still in operation include: La Boqueria; Mercat del Born, a modernist construction; Mercat de San Antoni located in the barrio, San Antoni; Mercat de San Andreu in San Andreu; Mercat de Santa Caterina in L'Eixample, Mercat de Ninot, in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Concepció also in L'Eixample; Mercat de la Llibertat in Gràcia; Mercat de Sants in Sants-Montjuich; Mercat de Galvany in Sarrià-Sant Gervasi; Mercat de Vall d'Hebron. In addition, Barcelona offers many non-food markets including the street market; La Flor de Las Ramblas; Dominical de Sant Antoni; Encants de Sant Antoni; and Encants Barcelona, Fira de Bellcaire.

Madrid
The main markets in central Madrid are San Anton Market; San Miguel Market, a gourmet tapas market; Cámera Agraria (Madrid Farmers' Market); and El Rastro, the largest open air flea market.

Valencia
The Mercat or Mercado Central is the main public market in Valencia. Built at the turn of the twentieth century, the building combines Gothic and Art Nouveau architectural features. Popular with both locals and visitors, a distinctive feature is the quality of fresh fish and seafood, which once purchased can be taken to the street stalls around the perimeter of the market who will cook it to order. The Mercado de Colón in Eixample, Valencia is also a very popular fresh produce market.

Seville
Popular markets in Seville include the Triana market and the Central market housed within the Metropol Parasol complex. In addition, Seville offers many smaller neighbourhood markets such as Mercado de la Calle Feria and Mercado de la Encarnación.

United States
In the United States, the term public market is often used for a place where vendors or merchants meet at the same location on a regular basis. A public market has a sponsoring entity that has legal and financial responsibility to oversee operations and, sometimes, provides facilities to house the market activity. Public markets may incorporate the traditional market activity – the sale of fresh food from open stalls – and may also offer a wide range of different products. Public markets may incorporate elements of specialized markets such as farmers markets, craft markets, and antique markets. Traditionally public markets in the US were owned and operated by city governments, but this is no longer the case.
According to the Ford Foundation, what distinguishes public markets from other types of related retail activity are three characteristics. Public markets:

have public goals, a defined civic purpose. Typically, these goals include: attracting shoppers to a central business district, providing affordable retailing opportunities to small businesses, preserving farming in the region, and activating or repurposing public space
are located in and/or create a public space in the community, where a wide range of people mix, and are, or aim to be, a heart of the community
are made up of locally owned, independent businesses operated by their owners, not franchises. This gives public markets a local flavor and unique experience.

Papua New Guinea
Drawing heavily on the anthropological literature, Benedicktsson argues that a distinct type of Melanesian market  that is substantially different to other Asian markets, can be identified. The key characteristics of the PNG market are that it is dominated by producer-sellers, most of whom are women. Prices are set at the start of the day's trade, and rarely change. Haggling and aggressive selling are rarely practised. At the end of the day's trade, produce is not cleared, but rather is taken away for the seller's private consumption or is distributed among kin and close family.

42,Bazaar of Pristina,"The Bazaar of Prishtina (Albanian: Çarshia e Prishtinës; Serbian: Базар у Приштини, romanized: Bazar u Prištini), Kosovo, was the core merchandising center of the Old Prishtina since the 15th century, when it was built. It played a significant role in the physical, economic, and social development of Pristina. The Old Bazaar was destroyed during the 1950s and 1960s, following the modernization slogan of ""Destroy the old, build the new"". In its place, buildings of Kosovo Assembly, Municipality of Prishtina, PTT, and Brotherhood and Unity socialist square were built. Nowadays, instead of PTT building resides the Government of Kosovo building. Only few historical buildings, such as the Bazaar Mosque and ruins of the Bazaar Hammam have remained from the Bazaar complex. Since then, Prishtina has lost part of its identity, and its cultural heritage has been scattered.

History
Bazaars (English marketplace, Turkish pazar, Serbian базар, Albanian çarshia) were unique trading complexes developed in the towns of Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans, while the area came under the Ottoman Empire. They were built during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, reaching their final shape in the 19th century. These traditional complexes were developed in two types: the Covered Bazaar or Bezistan and the Open Bazaar. While the first was a closed complex of stores, the second was characterized by consecutive rows of crafts shops, where on Tuesdays merchants exposed their products. Before their construction, people used to expose their crafts on the mosque walls, at the time being practiced only in Albanian towns.
In the 13th century, Pristina was referred to as a “village”, and in 1525 as a town, but was officially recognized only in 1775. During the 14th and 15th centuries, it became an important mining and trading center. As a Medieval trading center, the first merchants' shops emerged in the 16th century. In 1660, Evliya Çelebi claims that Pristina had a market area (Bazaar), a hammam, 11 khans and about 300 different shops. Shops were located in the Old Bazaar, which in the 18th and 19th century, was the most important economic entity. According to Ammie Boue, in 1830, the Old Bazaar was the central core of Pristina. At this time (1840), Bazaar of Pristina had around 200 crafts shops.

 
At this time, Pristina was also known for the tradesmen and craftsmen organized fairs. The first and biggest fair was in 1879, where 1200-1500 people were present. Branislav Nušić, the vice-consul of Kingdom of Serbia, after visiting Pristina in 1893–96, claimed that it had the liveliest trade. According to Nušić, in 1902 Pristina had 500 shops, 12 khans, 12 mosques, 1 Clock tower, and some warehouses. Between two World Wars, Pristina had 240 shops, mostly focused in the Old Bazaar. In the verge of Second World War, there were 365 private crafts shops, practicing about 60 different crafts. After the war, economy was industrialized, and crafts started fading.

Urban and social context of the Bazaar
Urban context
The Old Bazaar of Pristina was located in the core center of Pristina, exactly at the intersection of the two main roads, which influenced its physical, economic, and social developments. These arteries were the east–west direction or Divan-Yoll (today UÇK Street), and the north–south road (Corso, today Mother Teresa boulevard). Divan-Yoll was distinguished for the development of public domain and social life of the inhabitants, while the other road was important for the economic development. Along the north–south artery, a convoy of caravans were passing through to the other important cities of the Balkans, which influenced the development of Pristina.
On the other hand, bazaars were preferable to be located close to rivers, therefore Bazaar of Pristina was located approximately in-between Vellusha and Prishtevka rivers. Nowadays, both these rivers are covered. It was surrounded by Bedri Pejani Street in the west, UÇK Street in the north, Agim Ramadani Street in the east, and Mother Theresa Boulevard in the south. The most crowded area with shops was at the nowadays Government area.
Bazaar was not preliminary planned, but spontaneously developed along the organic network of roads. The main streets intersected at a rhombic square with a Round Fountain in the middle. These narrow roads were paved with cobblestones or macadam, and were kept very clean. In the 1950s, law for cleaning the streets was approved, according to which citizens were supposed to clean their gardens, shops, and streets, and then pile the garbage, which was later taken away by a phaeton. The Bazaar's streets were composed of parallel rows of single-story jointed shops. The residential areas were located outside the Bazaar, in a radial direction.

Architectural context
The bazaar was structured accordingly with the practiced crafts; hence each craft had its own alley. This principle was inherited from the Eastern Roman Empire. Bazaar stores were made of three main materials: adobe, wood, and stone. Masonry was made of adobe and stone. The roof structure, frontal facade, windows and eventually floor and ceiling were made of wood. From both functional and architectural viewpoints, the most important element of the stores was its frontal facade. The bazaar shops’ street facades were characterized by long eaves, large wooden windows, and multifunctional window shutters. During the day, while the shops were open, these wooden shutters were used as exposition racks. Opening and closing of the frontal shutters beside the door indicated whether the store was open or not for customers.
In general, bazaar shops were architecturally designed as single-story constructions, where the ground floor area was used for crafts-working, exposition, and trading area. Shortly, the same space was used for storing the raw material, manufacturing the artisanal products, and later exposing them for sale. Sometimes, besides the ground floor they also had an upper floor, mostly used as depot. Only during the second half of the 19th century they had two stories above. Among the shops, there were also some small cafes serving coffee, tea, and occasionally rakia.
The residential areas were located outside the Bazaar, in a radial direction, in the organic mahallas of Pristina. Houses were built on ground and first floor levels, which were constructed of strong materials and covered with tiles. Despite the influences of European architecture, their architecture remained native. These houses had great gardens, surrounded by exterior walls for family protection and privacy.

Social context
Bazaar was the most important trade and crafts center. It was famous for its annual trade fairs and goat hide and hair articles. Most notable traders were Jews, who were relatively educated and besides their own language also spoke Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, and Albanian. Bazaar of Pristina was also visited by other traders, mostly by Ragusans (from nowadays Dubrovnik), who became a vast colony. Being in such crossroads, Bazaar served as a linkage of local and other foreign craftsmen.
Craftsmanship and commerce networks were organized in guilds. Guilds were an Ottoman model of the corporate economy organizations. They protected economic, social, political, military, religious, educational and other craftsmen interests. These guilds had a common voluntary fund, which was used to financially support poor and ill craftsmen, to educate young artisans, to establish schools and build some public buildings. On the other hand, they controlled the economic life, especially the tanners and bakers guilds, which controlled the prices.
Besides trading, Bazaar of Pristina was also the main place for public encounters. Its shops were also used for blood feud reconciling, selling and purchasing of property, affiancing procedures, setting of marriage dates, developing patriotic feelings, and cultivating trust or Besa. Closeness of shops made people get closer with each other. There was a lot of respect among them. People used to hang around and drink tea with each other in front of their shops. Whenever a new shop opened, people used to throw coins on the ground, believing that this superstitious act would bring fortune. Other signs of good luck were horseshoes, and garlic head or horn.

Important building landmarks
Bazaar Mosque
Bazaar or Çarshi Mosque was initially started in 1389 as a mark of Ottoman forces victory in Kosovo Was, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century, by Sultan Bayazid. It was the first mosque built in Kosovo. By that time, it used to overlook over the covered part of Bazaar. Since then, Bazaar Mosque has gone through significant changes, being initially repaired in 1820 and 1902 by Sulltan Abdylhamid II. As a result, its original look has been modified, but the stone-topped minaret, its distinguishing symbol, has been preserved for more than a half millennium, respectively 600 years. Carshı Mosque is also known as ‘Tas Mosque’, which literally means ‘Stone Mosque’. Bazaar It is one of 21 protected buildings in Pristina, listed since 1967.

Bazaar Hammam
Bazaar or Old Hammam is assumed to have been built in the 15th century, approximately at the same time as the Great Hammam of Pristina. As a public bath for cleaning and recreation, it was an important part of Bazaar. The Old Hammam was located just in front of the Bazaar Mosque. Following the destruction of the Baazar, Hammam was ruined too. Its stone foundations were found during the construction of today's Kosovo Assembly building, in 1959. Besides of their listing for state protection, they were covered and no further researches of the Hammam building and site have been made.

Khan
Khans or inns were specific buildings located in Pristina’s Bazaar that offered accommodation for traders and their animals, serving as a facilitation of trade. Khan consisted of two floors. Ground floor was a shelter for animals, whereas the upper one was a shelter for people. There were served coffee, tea, and food. In 1870-1880 Pristina possessed around 10 Khans. Before Second World War there were 3 khans located in Korzo Street in the Old Bazaar.

Bezistan
In 1830, Pristina had a Covered Bazaar known as Bezistan. Among the inhabitants it was also known as ""Kapalı Çarshı"", according to the Turkish language. This structure was a distinguished road with parallel consecutive shops, surrounded by walls and closed with huge arched doors at both sides of the road. It was covered with bricks for around 15–20 meters at its entrance. The high security enabled safety provisions while trading valuable goods. The covered complex had nearly 150-200 crafts shops. Interior of the Bezistan was attractive and interesting, thus resembling the bazaars of many oriental kasabas. 
Covered Bazaar is supposed to have been located in the southern part of the Open Old Bazaar, in-between Carshı Mosque in the east and Korzo Street in the west; nowadays, approximately near the building of Assembly of Kosovo. In its western exit, between the crafts shops, complex was The Round Sadirvanc(“Shadërvani Rrethor”) with one fountain-head and concrete tub. Water from the fountain on the lower part of Bazaar, was used for maintaining the shops and other needs of inhabitants.

Synagogue
Synagogue, named ""Havra-Sinagoga"", was located in the southwestern part of the Bazaar, near the end of the Bezistan. It was used by Jews for their Saturday rituals. These Jews living in Pristina, were owners of many shops and their houses were lined along the Divan-Yol Street.

Bazaar Tekke
Bazaar Tekke was located near the western exit of the Covered Bazaar. It has also been destroyed.

Shops and crafts
Shops were decorated and filled with goods. There were shops of moccasin shoes, saddlers, curriers, Albanian fez makers, etc. Among which were from tanning to leather dyeing, belt making and silk weaving, and also military crafts as armorers, smiths, and saddle makers. In 1485 the artisans started producing gunpowder. There were also many cafés and tea shops, sweet-shops, and bakers. There were also other shops were oriental foods were served, kebab stores, butchers, pharmacies, libraries, barbers, watchmakers.
There were around 50 different handicrafts practiced in the Bazaar of Pristina. They were crafted by gifted silversmiths, goldsmiths, coppersmiths, tinsmiths, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, tub-makers, cutlers, potters, farriers, saddlers, boot makers, tailors, quilters, and curries. Especially Pristina was known as the center of coppersmiths and pottery crafting, which spread later in other Kosovo cities, such as Prizren, Gjakova, Peja, Gjilan. Copper pots were crafted for domestic and cult purposes. These pots were crafted from copper and brass by forging, smelting and savat techniques. On the other hand, clay pots were crafted for wheat and water preservation (water vessels and jugs). Decorations used in these crafts were wavy zigzag lines, circles, and semicircles.
Saddling was also developed in Pristina, besides Gjakova, Prizren, Gjilan, and Peja. Among the crafts were: horse and oxen gears, such as bridles, halters, tacks, collars, headgear, pads, saddles, stirrups, and cuirasses. These supplies were decorated with beads, charms, tufts, and mirrors.
Pristina was also identified with tailoring and silk processing. Tailors used to make national costumes mostly for wealthy class men and women. Among these items were waistcoats, coats, and robes.
Craftsmen of Pristina manufactured slippers as well. Slippers were made of soft leather (sahtian) fabric, embroidered with golden colored strings on the top. There were also shoe-crafts as leather shoes or moccasins, and clogs adorned with silver or pearly incrustation.
Crafts considered as touristic attractions containing folkloric elements, were supported with suitable shops and lower taxes. Also new crafts emerged as: radio-technicians, electro-technicians, hydro-installers, auto-mechanics, etc. Nowadays, most of handicrafts do not exist or have been transformed into new trades. Some of them are the handicraft of curriers, saddlers, tailors, silk processors, goat wool rug makers, and embroiders potters. On the other hand, even though in a small number, the old craft shops that still exist are blacksmiths and cutlers.

Destruction of the Bazaar
Early destruction
Bazaar and some other parts of Pristina were destroyed by two great fires in 1859 and 1863, just while Pristina was having its peak development.
In 1912, following the Serbian invasions, many feudal and intellectual Albanian and Turkish families were deported to Turkey. Among them were the main town's craftsmen. As a result, the shops were abandoned and Bazaar significance started fading.

Destroy the old, and build the new
The peak of communist politics was during the 1950s when the urban development was established under the motto “Destroy the old, build the new’. Pristina had eastern features till the end of the Second World War. After this period destruction of these characteristics and old parts of the city took place. 
The Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center (including mosques, churches, houses) were destroyed.
A significant part of old Pristina was destroyed to be replaced later with newer architecture. Old buildings were substituted with new ones, and streets were widened and paved with cobblestones. Few remaining old buildings, belonging to Ottoman period, were left without institutional care.
""Until the end of World War II, Pristina has been a typical oriental city. After liberation, Pristina experienced rapid development, becoming a modern city. Shops and unstable old structures started disappearing, making space for building high buildings of modern style”.
The so-called “Unstable old structures”, which covered one of the largest bazaars in the region were demolished after the war. This spiritual center of the city has lost its mosque, a catholic church and synagogues. Since the 1945, the story of Pristina is a gray, tragic story of its destruction and many misfortunes. During the communist era, the annihilation of the past was the outcome of non liberal politics. 
In the aftermath of World War Two, Yugoslavia was governed by communist authorities who implemented various modernisation drives toward changing the architectural landscape and design of urban settlements. These measures were aimed at altering the panorama of a settlement that was deemed to have elements associated with an unwanted Ottoman past and features deemed as ""backward"". Starting from the late 1940s, architectural heritage in main urban centres of Kosovo began to be destroyed, mainly conducted by the local government as part of urban modernisation schemes. During the 1950s this process was undertaken by the Urban Planning Institute (Urbanistički zavod) of Yugoslavia with the most prominent example in Kosovo of the socialist modernisation drive being in Pristina. The Ottoman Prishtina bazaar contained 200 shops set in blocks devoted to a craft or guild owned by Albanians grouped around a mosque, located in the centre of Prishtinë. These buildings were expropriated in 1947 and demolished by labour brigades known as Popular Fronts (Albanian: Fronti populluer, Serbian: Narodnifront).
After the Second World War in 1953, Pristina had its first urban plan, made by Serbian architect Partonic, approved. Citizens, eager for modern city, volunteered in the new city order. This was the starting point of the Bazaar destruction where many crafts shops were ruined to make space for the new Municipality Assembly and Parliament of Kosovo. Everything ‘old’ and of Albanian and Turkish roots was destroyed;  only a few remained. At that time, some Russian architects insisted on preserving the Bazaar's architecture. Nevertheless, the system decided to destroy everything.
In 1954, a master plan was approved by Institute for the Protection and Study of Cultural Monuments. The main element of it was the placement of a complex of new municipal and provincial government buildings at its center, where the Ottoman-era bazaar of Pristina was located. In the second half of the 1950s, some of the new buildings intended in Pristina's master plan were constructed such as: a provincial assemblage building, a city hall, and a new main street with modernist mixed-use buildings. All these buildings were located on the site of Pristina's destroyed bazaar or next to other condemned Ottoman-era architecture. The destruction of Ottoman-era architecture signified the beginning of modernization.
The most radical transformations in Bazaar of Pristina happened from 1960 to 1970. At this time, its small shops, streets, religious and other public buildings were destroyed for the sake of the new. Thus Pristina lost an important feature of its historic and cultural heritage. On the other hand, the shops’ destruction affected the craftsmen's lives. Some of them never recovered their businesses or migrated abroad.
Pristina was turned into an administrative town, from town of gardens and artisans. In the Bazaar area, new administrative buildings were built. In 1965, there was a public debate held among local experts of architecture and other relevant fields, city officials and citizens, who criticized this Urban Plan, which the architect could not justify. Since then, local experts made corrections and undertook further urban developments of Pristina. In 1966, few roads were paved and new high-rise socialist apartment blocks were built.

43,Chak No. 38,"Chak no 38 (Urdu: چک نمبر 38) is a village in Mandi Bahauddin District, Pakistan, located eight kilometres (5.0 mi) south of Mandi Bahauddin.
Its zip code is 50471. It was well known during British rule due to its organized bazaars and local markets which were under the control of the Chowdhury community. The village is named after the Choudhury tribes who traditionally came here with their families according to the normal practice for a Chak (village) of Pakistani Punjab. They lived beside a bend in the canal  which flows through an Upper Jehlum canal, which was a suitable, sheltered location. This is the reason why it is called Dinga Chak.

Demographics
The population of Chak No 38 is over 6,170 people including Daira's. The literacy rate is over 50%. There is the Government Primary School for Boys which is one of the oldest in the area and was established in 1992 and Elementary School for Girls which was established in 1993. There is also a Basic Health Unit in the village. Culturally, Dinga Chak is a very diverse village, with people from different clans residing.

Economy
Before 1993, agriculture was the only source of income for the people of the village but now many young men are working in Europe and the Middle East and send remittances home to their families. Many educated people are serving the nation and the area by working in government and private jobs after completing their higher education.

45,List of bazaars in Nepal,"A bazaar or souk, is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold.
The term bazaar originates from the Persian word bāzār. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the ""network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen"" who work in that area. Although the word ""bazaar"" is of Persian origin, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world.
The term souk (Arabic: سوق suq, Hebrew: שוק shuq, Syriac: ܫܘܩܐ shuqa, Armenian: շուկա shuka, Spanish: zoco, also spelled souq, shuk, shooq, soq, esouk, succ, suk, sooq, suq, soek) is used in Western Asian, North African and some Horn African cities (Amharic: ሱቅ sooq).

46,Rangeli Municipality,"Rangeli is a Municipality and rural market town in Morang District in the Koshi Zone of south-eastern Nepal. This municipality was formed merging existing four villages i.e.Amgachhi, Babiabirta, Darbesa and Rangeli itself since May 2014.
At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 12,325 people living in 2463 individual households.
It is in the centre of a fertile agricultural region and there are numerous factories surrounding the town such as brick kilns and rice mills. Rangeli is linked by regular buses to the industrial city of Biratnagar.
Rangeli was once the district headquarters of Morang district, and was in the past a historically important trading town, although its role has declined over the last half a century with the growth of Biratnagar.  Nevertheless, it remains an important market centre serving south-eastern Morang district.
The first recorded settlement  in the region dates back to 7th century,  when King Mung Mawrong Hang came to prominence in the historical terai lands of Limbuwan (present-day Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa area). He cleared much of the forest area in present-day Rangeli, east of Biratnagar, and built a town there. He named his Kingdom Morang after his name and rose to power.

Wards
There are 9 wards in Rangeli, made up from wards of the former village development committees as follows:

49,"Maru, Kathmandu","Maru (Nepali: मरु) is a historic neighborhood in central Kathmandu, Nepal and one of the most important cultural spots in the city. It is linked with the origin of the name Kathmandu, and forms part of what is generically known as Durbar Square (including Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square), the old royal palace complexes of temples, shrines and palace buildings all of which have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Maru is also a market square, a venue for religious festivals and a celebrated residential quarter. It is a crossroads where two ancient trade routes connecting India and Tibet intersect.
Maru consists of a large square encircled by temples and rest houses. It presents an example of a temple square typical of traditional Newar urban planning. Streets radiate out from the square, and inconspicuous entryways lead to residential courtyards that are home to silversmiths and other craftsmen.

Highlights
The square is dominated by the massive pagoda roofs of Maru Satah (मरु सत:) (Kasthamandap) which stands on the northern side of the square. Built in the 12th century, it houses a shrine of Gorakhnath. It was erected as a shelter for travellers on the trade route, and assumed its present shape in the 17th century. The name Kathmandu is derived from Kasthamandap.
On the eastern side stands Dhansā Degah (धन्सा देग:) (alternative name: Dhunsar), a 17th-century pagoda-shaped building. Its carved wood windows provide a specimen of the art of woodworking which has been highly developed in the Kathmandu Valley since ancient times. The upper part was destroyed in the great earthquake of 1934, and its height was shortened when it was repaired. It was originally a courthouse. A shrine to Nāsa Dya (नास: द्य:), the god of music, exists on the ground floor.
Silyan Sata (सिँल्यं सत:) (alternative name Singha Satah) on the southern side of the square dates from the 17th century. It contains shops on the ground floor and a hymn singing hall on the upper floor.
Gakuti (गकुति) is a three-sided courtyard on the western side of Maru. There is a temple dedicated to Mahadev at the center.
Lakhu Phalechā (लखु फलेचा), a roadside shelter at the corner of an alley at the southwest of Maru, is linked with the founding of Nepal Sambat. This is where the porters from Bhaktapur are said to have rested with their loads of sand. The procession of the goddess Dāgin, which is held during the Yenya festival, starts from this house.
The temple of Maru Ganeshya (मरु गनेद्य:) on the northern side of Maru Sata is one of the more important Ganesh shrines in Kathmandu. A notable feature of this temple is the absence of the usual pinnacle.
Maruhiti (मरुहिति) is a celebrated stone water spout on an alley at the northwest of Maru. The alley was once famed by its nickname Pie Alley for the many pie shops here during the hippie days of the 1960s and 1970s.

50,Indra Chowk,"Indra Chowk (Nepali: इन्द्रचोक; pronounced [indra t͡sok]) or Wongha: (Newari) is one of the ceremonial and market squares on the artery passing through the historic section of Kathmandu, Nepal. The intersection of Indra Chowk, along with Maru, Kathmandu Durbar Square, Makhan, Jana Baha, Asan and Naxal, mark the old India-Tibet trade route that is now a vibrant market street.
Six streets meet at Indra Chowk and link the square to Kathmandu's major localities. Its temples and bazaar draw streams of pilgrims and shoppers. The square is named after Indra, lord of heaven in Hindu mythology.
Indra Chowk is a ceremonial venue and major festival pageants and chariot processions pass through the square. During Indra Jatra, the chariots of Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav are pulled through here. The chariot procession of Jana Baha Dyah Jatra also passes through the square.

Highlights
The large temple of Akash Bhairav (alternative name: Āju Dyah आजुद्यः) on the western side of the square is the symbol of Indra Chowk. The temple houses a large mask of Akash Bhairav, which means ""god of the sky"", up a flight of stairs. The ground floor contains shops.
A Shiva Temple stands on the northern side of the square. The original pagoda structure was completely destroyed during the Great earthquake of 1934, and it has been replaced with a small domed shrine.
Raki Bazaar, a twisting alley lined with small shops selling glass beads, is situated on the eastern side of the square. The ancestors of the merchants here are believed to have come from Iraq during the medieval period, and the name Raki Bazaar derived from the term Iraqi.
Shukra Path is the wide road leading south from the square to New Road. It is lined with identical white-washed stucco houses and was built after the 1934 earthquake. Named after martyr Shukra Raj Shastri, it is a fancy shopping street and a Kathmandu landmark.
A small temple of Ganesh (alternative name Ganedya गनेद्य:) stands at the southwestern corner of the square. The street leads to Makhan and Durbar Square.

51,Baglung,"Baglung is a municipality in Gandaki Province, in western Nepal, 275 km (171 mi) west of Kathmandu. It is the administrative headquarters of Baglung District. Baglung serves as the major center for business, finance, education, service and healthcare for the people of mid-Kali Gandaki valley that encompass Beni, Jaljala, Baglung, Kushma, Kathekhola, Galkot, Phalewas and Jaimuni local bodies. The city is located at the cross-section of Kaligandaki corridor highway and midhill highway that transverse Nepal in north–south and east–west directions respectively.

Geography and climate
Baglung Bazar is situated on a plateau overlooking the Kali Gandaki gorge directly south of the Dhaulagiri Himalayan range. Steep cliffs rising from the valley flank the plateau on three sides. City limits are roughly determined by the Theule Khola to the south, Kali Gandaki river to the east and Dhodeni Khola to the north.
Baglung enjoys warm summers and mild winters. Annual average temperatures range from a maximum of 26.6 °C (79.9 °F) and a minimum of 19.1 °C (66.4 °F). Highs above 35 °C (95 °F) and lows below 0 °C (32 °F) are rare. The average annual rainfall recorded is 1,060.9 mm (41.77 in) in 1982. Rainfall is heavily affected by the monsoon and most of it occurs during the months of June through September. Rest of the year is mostly dry and sunny. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city core, however, higher elevations within the city limits see occasional snow during the winter months. Due to large topographic variation climate ranging from hot subtropical to temperate montane climate can be experienced within the city limits.

History
Pilgrims from India and rest of Nepal traveling to Muktinath and traders seeking to barter grains from the south with salt from Tibet frequented a trade route along the banks of Kaligandaki river since ancient times. However, owing to its location high above the banks of Kaligandaki river and the trade route few actually ventured into the area that is Baglung Bazar today. The area also lacked reliable source of water for drinking and irrigation making it poorly suited for settlement. A lack of evidence of structures and settlements predating 16th century in the area and a lack of mention in historical records predating 16th century support this notion. First confirmed history of settlement in Baglung is found during the reign of King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat (later Galkot) Kingdom in the early 16th century.
In year 1534 AD King Pratapi Narayan of Parbat married daughter of king Manimukunda Sen of Palpa. As the wedding procession reached Baglung, following a dream, the king decided to establish goddess Kalika brought from Palpa at the site. Holder of the goddesses sword Chakra Panwar was given the title of Khadka and asked to stay back as caretaker of the goddess. He was also bestowed with the land that forms Baglung Bazar today. The Magar carriers of the idol were settled in Lung Gau area of Baglung. A temple was built and an annual fair was started during the Chaitre Dashain festival. Descendants of Chakra Panwar Khadka built irrigation channels, pastures, watering holes, fruit gardens and established first establishments in Baglung. Baglung also emerged as an outpost for revenue collection and taxation as the Khadka family also served as local revenue collection officers and militia commanders.
Three hundred years later, following annexation of the Parbat kingdom by Gorkha, Newar traders from Bhaktapur arrived in Baglung and established permanent trading houses and market. During this era Baglung was also proclaimed as a ""choti gauda"" or district headquarters and official judicial, military, mint and taxation offices were established. Baglung continued to act as administrative headquarters during the Rana regime. After establishment of the current district and zonal system Baglung retained its status as headquarters serving the area.

Transportation
Completion of several road projects have put Baglung at the crossroads of major north–south and east–west highway systems of Nepal. Tracks have been opened for Kaligandaki corridor highway connecting Tibet to the north via Mustang and border towns in the south. Similarly, midhill highway that connects eastern and western halves of Nepal passes through the city. Hari Bahadur Khadka memorial road connects Baglung with Kushmi Sera in the south and also provides access to Balewa airport.  Baglung is connected to Beni Bazar of Myagdi to the north and Kusma Bazar of Parbat which are located 13 km (8.1 mi) to the north and 12 km (7.5 mi) to the south-east, respectively. Pokhara Baglung highway connects the town with Pokhara, 72 km (45 mi) to the east. Another important road network connecting Gulmi district in the south originates in Baglung Bazar and passes via Sigana, Gaja and Bareng. Recently under initiative of late member of parliament Hari Bahadur Khadka a road network connecting Baglung Bazar with Bihu that passes through settlements higher in the northern flanks of Kathe Khola valley has been completed. In addition to major highways several narrow seasonal dirt roads connect the town with adjoining rural areas.
Suspension bridges meant for foot traffic are abundant in the area. So much so that the moniker ""land of suspension bridges"" is used to identify Baglung. Important crossings over Kaligandaki river are located at Pharse, Nirahe, Nayapul and Kaiya. The bridge over Kaligandaki connecting Kaiya with Kushma is notable for having the highest and longest span in Nepal. A mechanical cable-car spans the Kaligandaki river connecting Narayansthan with Kushma. Many other suspension bridges can be found spanning numerous rivers and rivulets within the city limit.
Baglung airport (code: BGL), in Balewa, is located 12 km to the south of the town across the valley from Kusma. With the completion of the Pokhara-Baglung highway this airport has fallen into disuse. Water transportation is virtually absent. However, the adjoining Kali Gandaki river offers some of the best white-water rafting in Nepal and attracts a decent number of thrill seekers every year.

57,Bandipur Rural Municipality,"Bandipur (Nepali: बन्दिपुर) is a hilltop settlement and a rural municipality in Tanahun District, Gandaki province of Nepal. Bandipur is primarily known for its preserved, old time cultural atmosphere. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of total (Bandipur and Dharampani) 15,591 people living in 3,750 individual households.

Location
Bandipur is located at 27.56 N, 84.25 E and an elevation of 1030m on a mountain saddle (Mahabharat range) approximately 700m above the Marsyangdi River Valley, 143 km to the west of Kathmandu and 80 km to the east of Pokhara. Since 1998 it is connected by an 8 km access road from Dumre (Prithvi Highway). Until then there was only an unreliable road, in monsoon usually not accessible or only by tractors. The mountain saddle, just 200m long, is barely wide enough to accommodate the main street lined by 2 –3 storey buildings on either side. At the backsides of these houses the mountainsides steeply descend and the gardens are only accessible by stairs.

History
Bandipur was established as a funnelling point of trade by Newar traders from Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu valley after it had been conquered in 1768 by Prithvi Narayan Shah. They took advantage of its malaria free location to develop it into an important stop along the India-Tibet trade route. With them they brought their cultural heritage and architecture which basically has remained unchanged to this day.
Originally a simple Magar village in the early 19th. Century Bandipur developed into prosperous trading centre and a community with town-like features: substantial buildings, with their neoclassical façades and shuttered windows and streets paved with slabs of silverish slate.
Bandipur had its heyday in the Rana times (1846-1951), when, as a measure of its power and prestige, it was granted special permission to have its own library (still existing).
In the 1970s, trading fell into a steep decline with the construction of the Prithvi Highway. For technical reasons it was logically built in the Marsyangdi valley, leaving Bandipur isolated up on the mountain. In addition to that, as a result of its poor accessibility, Bandipur lost importance because the district headquarters of Tanahun were moved to Damauli. The tradesmen of Bandipur were forced to move down to Dumre and many even left for the Terai; Bandipur turned a semi-ghost town. The population declined considerably.
On two occasions Bandipur has witnessed some turmoil. The people were not easily and readily sidestepped by the construction of the road and fought for a different route in the planning process. In the 1970s, when the first demonstrations for democracy took place in Nepal, the people of Bandipur stormed the little garrison. Several people were killed and the soldiers fled. Again, when the district headquarters were to be moved, the people demonstrated and occupied the administration. The civil servants fled during the night. Even the king was flown in by helicopter to calm the situation. However, the decline of the little town could not be reversed.
Some relics of its wealthy past remain. Although many houses are in bad condition, the typical Newari architecture is preserved. A distinctive aspect of Bandipur's main street is a covered veranda extending along almost the entire length on the northern side. Most of the buildings still have little shops in them. The slate slabs in the main street have been destroyed by heavy vehicles, for which they were not made, but they can still be made out along the edges and in the smaller alleys. The library still exists and was carefully renovated in 2000. Another relic is a soccer-field-sized Tundikhel to the northeast of Bandipur and the villages importance as centre for schools for the surrounding villages.

58,Old Bazaar of Korçë,"Old Bazaar of Korçë is an Ottoman-era bazaar in Korçë, Albania.
Established about 500 years ago, it is composed of old Ottoman and Roman architectonic style buildings which for centuries were used as shops, guesthouses or khans. It is said to be noted for selling goats and handbags.
It was mostly rebuilt in 1879 following an extensive fire
The old bazaar comprises 138 first category culture monuments.  It is also called as the Bazaar of the Serenades, associated with the music which for centuries was composed and sung by people whilst walking with a guitar on the round cobblestone.

Renovation
In 2015 it was announced that the bazaar would be renovated and transformed into a hub for tourists visiting the city, due to a $4 million restoration project financed by the Albanian Development Fund and the Albanian American Fund for Development.

59,Shkodër Bazaar,"The Shkodër Bazaar (also known as the Grand Bazaar or the Old Bazaar) was the economic and civic hub of Shkodër, Albania for centuries and was one of the most important trade hubs in the Western Balkans. After the rise of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania in 1944, the bazaar became a camp for refugees from the Orthodox population of Greek-speaking Albanians fleeing the Greek Civil War. In 1968, the bazaar was demolished and replaced with a park.

Location
The Bazaar lay at the foot of Rozafa Castle, about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) south of the modern city center, on the plain stretching to the bank of the Buna. According to legend, the bazaar dates to before the city fell to the Ottoman Empire and once stretched all the way to the Qafa neighborhood. This is attested to in Marin Barleti’s book on the Siege of Shkodra in 1478-79.

History
A market was held there from the earliest times. As early as the 14th century, the Statutes of Scutari refer to the area as a favolete (trading post). Originally associated with the river pier and the holdings of the Bushati family, the Bazaar became one of the most famous markets in the Balkans. It continued to play a major role in the craft trade as late as the 1870s, when as many as 2500 merchants were licensed to trade there.
Beginning in the 1860s, the Bazaar began to decline due a variety of factors. These included competition from industrial production, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the construction of the Mitrovica-Thessaloniki Railway, Montenegro’s annexation of Ulcinj and Bar in 1880, flooding, general Ottoman decline, steamships on the Danube, competition from Edirne, and a 1905 earthquake. During the Montenegrin occupation of Albania in the Balkan Wars, departing troops burned the prime wheat and barley shops completely down, damaging 250 stands.

Decline
Major historical factors in the decline of the Bazaar include the following:

Damage during World War I
Changes in the flow of the Drin that swelled the Bojana up the plain and flooded the most picturesque part of the Bazaar
In 1940, road construction from Molo to Bahçallëk cut off the waterfront.

60,List of bazaars in Albania,"A bazaar or souk, is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold.
The term bazaar originates from the Persian word bāzār. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the ""network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen"" who work in that area. Although the word ""bazaar"" is of Persian origin, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world.
The term souk (Arabic: سوق suq, Hebrew: שוק shuq, Syriac: ܫܘܩܐ shuqa, Armenian: շուկա shuka, Spanish: zoco, also spelled souq, shuk, shooq, soq, esouk, succ, suk, sooq, suq, soek) is used in Western Asian, North African and some Horn African cities (Amharic: ሱቅ sooq).

The name of the neighbourhood stems from the groceries marketplace (the bazaar, in Albanian: pazar), which is situated in the area. It is located east of the central boulevard. Along with Mujos it forms part of the Old Town of Tirana and is one of the oldest areas of the city. The old historic Kokonozi Mosque of Ottoman times is situated here.
The market offers a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables grown locally in the surrounding areas of Tirana, fish and meat, regional Albanian wine and raki. Many colorful buildings, restaurants and bakeries are surrounded. Recently, there have been a raising interest to make the Bazaar a touristic attraction. However, in 2017, the bazaar were renovated and reconstructed.
The New Bazaar was built, before the reconstruction of 2016, in 1931 at the same place where the historic Old Bazaar were built, the latter extending up to present day Skanderbeg Square.

62,"Old Bazaar, Bitola","The Old Bazaar (Macedonian: Стара чаршија, romanized: Stara čaršija) is a bazaar located in Bitola, North Macedonia, situated on the northern bank of the Dragor River in the centre of the city. The bazaar has served as a centre of trade activity for Bitola since the 15th century. As the third-most important European city in the mid-19th century Ottoman Empire after Istanbul and Thessaloniki, Bitola had over 2,000 shops with roughly 140 different crafts and professions present.
The bazaar in its entirety is listed as an Object of Cultural Heritage by the Ministry of Culture, while several houses, commercial buildings, mosques, and hamams within it are also listed individually.

Landmarks
Bezisten
Opposite the Clock Tower across the Dragor River, the bezisten is a covered market. Built with the appearance of a fortress, it housed a variety of shops and the studios of the prominent artists of the city.

Deboj Hamam
The Deboj Hamam was built in the 17th or early 18th century. It consists of two main rooms. The hamam was later used as a warehouse for various goods.

Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque
North of the present boundary of the Old Bazaar, the Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque was built in 1561. It features a main dome, a portico capped by three cupolas, and one minaret.

Ishak Çelebi Mosque
On the western end of the bazaar, the Ishak Çelebi Mosque is across the street from the bezisten. Built in 1506, it is the largest mosque in Bitola.

Kerim Bey Hamam
Also known simply as the Old Turkish Hamam, water was brought in from the Dragor with pipes and was heated with wood. Prior to World War II, it was primarily used by the Jews of Bitola.

63,"Old Bazaar, Prilep","The Old Bazaar (Macedonian: Стара чаршија, romanized: Stara čaršija) is a bazaar located in Prilep, North Macedonia. It is located east of the main city square and north of the Prilep River. The bazaar dates from the second half of the 18th century, when Prilep grew in commercial and economic significance. Most of its present appearance dates from the 19th century.
The bazaar is listed as an Object of Cultural Heritage by the Ministry of Culture, while several commercial buildings, the city clock tower, a mosque, and а hamam within it are also listed individually. Many of the historic crafts present in Prilep's bazaar are at risk of dying out or already have died out due to industrial production. The pottery trade, for instance, was once represented in 38 shops employing about 360 people; just one such shop remains today.

Landmarks
Clock Tower
Prilep's hexagonal Clock Tower is located at the heart of the bazaar and dominates its skyline. It was built in 1858 in a neoclassical style, following a fire which destroyed the previous clock tower. Designed by Petrе Lautsо, its building was funded by the city residents. It is intact since its original construction and stands 38 m (125 ft) tall. The Clock Tower is considered a leaning tower.

Čarši Mosque
Directly south of the Clock Tower is the Čarši Mosque, built in 1476 or 1477. It is also known as the Haci Hüseyin ben Abdallah Mosque, after the individual who ordered its construction. The date of its construction is a signifier of the time around when the commercial centre of Prilep shifted from its previous hub at the Varoš area below Marko's Towers to the plain further below through which the Prilep River passes. Much of the mosque was destroyed in a fire in 1856/1857. Afterwards, it consisted of an original portion and a reconstructed portion. Its single minaret has two balconies.
The mosque sits in ruins after it was deliberately set on fire on 8 August 2001 by locals in response to the Karpalak ambush on the same day, in which 10 Macedonian security members from Prilep were killed by the National Liberation Army, part of the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia. The Macedonian government, with the assistance of UNESCO and Turkish foundations, had plans to reconstruct the mosque three years after it was razed, but the project did not take hold due to opposition from local residents.

Itar Pejo fountain
The bazaar has a fountain with a depiction of the Itar Pejo character of Macedonian folklore. Sculpted by Zharko Basheski, the monument was completed in 2008.

Turkish Bath
The Turkish Bath sits at the northern edge of the bazaar on Goce Delčev Boulevard. It is in poor, nearly ruined condition.

64,"Old Bazaar, Skopje","The Old Bazaar (Macedonian: Стара чаршија, romanized: Stara čaršija; Albanian: Çarshia e Vjetër; Turkish: Eski Çarşı or Üsküp Türk Çarşısı) also known as Turkish Bazaar (Macedonian: Турска чаршија, romanized: Turska čaršija; Albanian: Çarshia e Vjetër Turke) is a bazaar located in Skopje, North Macedonia, situated on the eastern bank of the Vardar River, stretching from the Stone Bridge to the Bit-Pazar and from the Skopje Fortress to the Serava river. The Old Bazaar falls primarily within the borders of Čair Municipality but a part of it is located in Centar Municipality. As one of the oldest and largest marketplaces in the Balkans, it has been Skopje's centre for trade and commerce since at least the 12th century.
The earliest known sources that describe the existence of a merchant quarter on the bazaar's territory date back to the 12th century. During Ottoman rule of Skopje, the Old Bazaar developed rapidly to become city's main centre of commerce. The Ottoman history of the bazaar is evidenced by roughly thirty mosques, numerous caravanserais and hans, among other buildings and monuments. The bazaar was heavily damaged by the earthquake in 1555, the burning of the city in 1689, the earthquake in 1963, as well as during the First and the Second World Wars and faced various rebuildings following these events.
Beside its importance as a market place, the Old Bazaar is known for its cultural and historical values.  Although Ottoman architecture is predominant, remains of Byzantine architecture are evident as well, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to modern architecture. The Old Bazaar is still home to several active mosques, türbes, two churches and a clocktower, that, together with the buildings of the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia and the Museum of Modern Art, form the core of the modern bazaar.
In recent years there have been a raising interest to make the Bazaar a touristic attraction. On 13 October 2008, the Macedonian Parliament adopted a law recognising the Old Bazaar as cultural heritage of particular importance for the country to be permanently protected. In early 2010, the Macedonian Government began a project for the revitalisation of the Old Bazaar, which includes the restoration of several objects and aiming a further economic and cultural development of the site.

History
Machiel Kiel has been conducting a contemporary architectural survey of the old bazaar before the Skopje earthquake of 1963.

Early period
The earliest known archaeological findings revealed at the Kale Fortress testify that the surrounding area has been inhabited since 4,000 BC, while the earliest historical facts mention the Paeonians as the first people who settled up on this area.
Following the fall of the city of Scupi under Roman rule, numerous Roman buildings, such as temples, thermaes, and theatres were built inside the city, that subsequently promoted it as an important religious and cultural centre in the Roman Empire.
In 518, Scupi was heavily damaged by a devastating earthquake, which prompted the Byzantine emperor Justinian I to rebuild a new capital that was located distantly from the destroyed city. Nevertheless, the local population settled up on a hilly area, where, later, the emperor Justinian ordered the construction of the Kale Fortress.
During the reign of king Samuel, Skopje was given a particular strategic, political, economic, and cultural importance, so that the surrounding area of the Kale hill was embanked by the enactment of defensive walls, in order to keep the treasures that were present in the settlement. At the time, there was a gate named ""Watertower Gate"", which was built with the purpose to defend the city against the successive attacks by the Byzantine emperor Basil II in 1001.

Middle Ages
Byzantine rule
After the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire under Byzantine rule in 1018, the emperor Basil II transformed Skopje into a capital of a theme and an episcopal see, whose bishop was elected for a four-year term. Following the death of Basil, his successor, Romanos III Argyros, undertook activities to reconstruct the Monastery of St. Georgi, which was situated on the place where today the Sultan Murad Mosque is located. It is said that the monastery, at the time, was one of the most reputable and decorated monasteries in most of the Balkans.
With the coming to power of the Komnenni dynasty in the beginning of the 12th century, the city lived a relatively calm period and saw significant development. The development was followed by construction of walls and defense towers around Dolengrad, monasteries and churches. Strong development contributed to the city to take the position of an important trading center which was visited by merchants from many other places like Dubrovnik and Republic of Venice.

Serbian rule
In 1282, the Serbian King Stefan Uros II Milutin conquered Skopje, the city became a part of Raska and later within the medieval Serbian state. This period is characterized by the construction of numerous churches, monasteries and palaces in and around the city. During his stay in Skopje in 1299 and 1300, the Byzantine envoy Theodore Metochites noted that apart Gorengrad, there was Dolengrad, which was protected by walls.
King Stefan Dusan  In 1345 Skopje was declared the capital of Serbian Kingdom by Stefan Dusan. The following year he was crowned king in Skopje. During this time the area of bazaar was a particular shopping center, but the city generally stated as the main trade center with developed crafts, where a special role had  merchants from Dubrovnik and Republic of Venice. In addition it is possible that today's Sultan Murat mosque is located in the exact place where Dushan's royal palace was.
After the death of Stefan Dusan, the city was under Serbian rule until 1385 when Vuk Brankovic surrendered to the Ottomans and Skopje became part of the Ottoman Empire.

Ottoman Period
The conquest by the Ottoman Turks  rapidly began to change the ethnic composition of the Skopje. The wealth with which handled the local churches, monasteries, and the population itself passed into the hands of the Turks. The city transformed into a military stronghold and the construction of several buildings of religious character changed the architecture of the city. A number of typical Ottoman  buildings were built immediately after the conquest. Those objects were built primarily to serve Muslim population.
Major changes to the architectural character of the current Old Bazaar occurred during governorship of Ishak Beg and his son Isa Bey. Ishak Beg began construction of Sultan Murad Mosque, which construction was completed in 1436. In 1438 began construction of Ishak Beg Mosque and the mausoleum where Ishak Beg was buried. After his death his son and successor, Isa Beg, constructed numerous buildings in what is today Old Bazaar. These buildings, constructed between 1445 and 1469, were indispensable for the economic development of the city. Thus, during this time Skopje saw new buildings like Bezisten and Çifte Hamam. After the death of Isa Beg, in accordance with his testament was built Isa Beg Mosque (1475) and later Haji-kasamova mosque (1489–1490) and Mustafa Pasha Mosque (1492).
In the period from 1489 to 1497 Daut Pasha, Grand Vesir of East Rumelia, invested in the construction of several buildings in the bazaar, among which the most famous is Daut Pasha Hamam. At the same time were built imarets i.e. public houses where food was prepared and served  to the homeless and travelers who have stayed in the city.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Bazaar reached its urban and economic zenith, developing into one of the greatest oriental bazaars in the Balkans. The accelerated development of trade and the construction of new stores and facilities continued further. In 1504, near the bazaar, Yahya Pasha built Yahya Pasha Mosque which still survives today. Kurşumli Han inn was built in the middle of the century, and in 1543 began the construction of the Church of the Ascension of Jesus, which was the first Christian project that was approved during the Ottoman period in Skopje. The strong earthquake which struck in Skopje 1555, caused massive damage in the bazaar, but the city soon recovered and continued unimpeded development of trade. During this time most of trade took place thanks to the influential Jewish colony and other colonies were created like that of merchants from Dubrovnik.

Modern period
Yugoslavia
There are preserved important buildings of the Ottoman period within the Old Bazaar. The buildings have undergone changes in their social, religious and cultural usage such as mosques that were linked with madrassas, caravansaries, libraries, water fountains and burial chambers. Following the 1963 earthquake, urban planners pursued a museification of the area reserving it mainly for foreign visitors and ideological reasons for doing so were based upon Yugoslav socialism and its understandings of secularism and modernity.

Independent Macedonia
For some months following the inter-ethnic conflict of 2001, Macedonians were cautious and hesitant to stroll around the Old Bazaar as the place is associated with criminality, uncleanliness and Albanians.
From 2005 onward Čair municipality outlined a vision for the capital city's historic core and implemented policies that promoted the revival of the Old Bazaar to its former Ottoman state with specific boundaries for the area. Its initiatives include the refurbishment of the area's historical architecture, inaugurating a Jazz festival, opening a House of the esnaf (professional guilds with Ottoman era origins) and reserving a hall for the arts and music. The urban planners of Čair, mainly Albanians, view the Old Bazaar as characterised by its Ottoman heritage and identity that was neglected or destroyed by architects from the Yugoslav and post Yugoslav eras. The local Turkish community of Skopje has significantly contributed to the history of the Old Bazaar and supported initiatives for the refurbishment of Skopje's historical core associated with the Ottoman period. Due to five centuries of Ottoman rule the old Bazaar is still filled with preserved Ottoman style buildings, narrow cobblestone walkways, many mosques and small craftsmen shops. The Old Bazaar is a travel destination for tourists from overseas.

Public Opinion
Different perspectives based on community experiences of the space exists among Albanians and Macedonians of the history of the Old Bazaar. For local Albanians, the Yugoslav era and its socialist understanding of architectural modernism resulted in neglect and failure to properly restore Ottoman religious heritage in the area. Tourism existed and the area economically benefited until the Yugoslav financial crisis of the 1980s. Following independence in 1991, the political elite in power took a nationalist path and as the Old Bazaar is perceived as Albanian it was allowed to decay. A refurbishment initiative during the 1990s on the Old Stone Bridge prevented people from crossing the structure and it resulted in negative economic effects for many craftsmen of the Old Bazaar. Following the 2001 conflict and the 2004 redrawing process of municipality borders, against a backdrop of limited state funds the Old Bazaar has flourished once again due to a proactive mayor, municipal actions and initiatives resulting in new urban development.
For local Macedonians the Old Bazaar of the 1960s was industrious, lively, disorderly and a multiethnic place where Macedonians, Albanians, Turks and Romani lived, traded and worked alongside each other. Over a span of twenty to thirty years the area underwent a demographic change of Albanisation and it became reflected in the usage of the Latin alphabet and Albanian writing in shops of the Old Bazaar. At the beginning of the 1990s the Old Bazaar was associated with Albanian criminality and the black market. Toward the end of the decade the Old Bazaar was still a popular place for Macedonian youth to socialise with friends. The historical core of Skopje was viewed as more aesthetically pleasing unlike the southern half of the capital with its socialist era buildings. Many cafes and restaurants existed and received visits from the few foreigners working in Macedonia. The conflict of 2001 was the turning point as Macedonians abandoned the Old Bazaar for the right bank of the river Vardar, especially after new restaurants and bars opened in that area. Following those transformations the Old Bazaar gained an Albanian character.

Landmarks
Bezisten
Skopje's bezisten, a covered market, was built in the 15th century by Gazi Ishak Bey, the Sultan's Skopje regent. It was destroyed by a fire in 1689 and was later rebuilt. The bezisten has looked the same since its renovation in 1899.

Clock tower
Skopje's clock tower, built in the 16th century on the foundations of an older edifice, is located just north of the Sultan Murad Mosque. Originally built of wood, the top was replaced with bricks in 1902.
The hexagonal tower was heavily damaged during the 1963 earthquake. It was soon fully repaired.

Čifte Hamam
The Čifte Hamam (Turkish for 'double bath'), located in the centre of the old bazaar, was built in the 15th century under Isa Bey. The building is divided into two wings (hence the name 'double'): one for men and one for women. The layout of both sections are nearly identical.
The Čifte Hamam was used as a bathhouse until 1915. After suffering damages during the 1963 earthquake, it was repaired and has housed the Contemporary Art Gallery since then.

Daut Pasha Hamam
Daut Pasha, Grand Vesir of East Rumelia, constructed this hamam in the 15th century. The building consists of fifteen rooms covered by thirteen domes. The two largest domes covered the two changing rooms and the rest of the domes covered individual bathing rooms.
Since 1948, the Daut Paşa Hamam has housed the National Art Gallery.

Isa Bey Mosque
Situated on the outskirts of the bazaar, this mosque was built as a memorial for Isa Bey after his death. The mosque has two dominant domes and five smaller ones above the porch area.

Ishak Bey Mosque
Also known as the Decorated (Aladža) Mosque because of the floral decorations, inscriptions and coloured tiles found on its walls, the Ishak Bey Mosque was constructed in 1438 in the northern part of the Old Bazaar. The mosque's minaret rises 30 meters (98.4 feet). There is a türbe located behind the mosque.  Within this mosque was one of the first Islamic libraries in Europe.

Kale Fortress
Located on the highest hill in Skopje, overlooking the city and the river, the area upon which the fortress was built was first inhabited in prehistoric times, according to archaeological findings.
Most researchers believe that the fortress was first constructed in the 11th century.

Kapan Han
One of the three remaining caravanserais in the Old Bazaar, the Kapan Han was built in the 15th century. The rooms in the upper floor were available to guests, while the ground floor was used as a stable to house the guests' horses and cattle.

Kuršumli Han
The largest of the three remaining caravanserais, the Kuršumli Han (Turkish for 'Lead Inn') was built by Musein Odza, the son of a scientist at Sultan Selim II's court, in the 16th century.
The roof of the inn was once covered in lead (hence the name), but was removed during World War I. The Kuršumli Han also has several small pyramidically-shaped domes. The building has a ground floor, which housed the cattle and horses, and a first floor, which housed the guests.
The attached mosque, built in the 17th century, and most of the hamam, built in the 15th century, were destroyed in the 1963 earthquake.
Today, the former han houses the statue collection of the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia.

Mustafa Pasha Mosque
The Mustafa Pasha Mosque, built in 1492 by Mustafa Pasha on an older Christian site, stands above the Old Bazaar, near Kale Fortress. Considered one of the most elegant Islamic buildings in Macedonia, the complex includes the mosque, the tomb of Mustapha Paşa, the sarcophagus of one of his daughters, a fountain, and remnants of other buildings.
The mosque is square in shape and its largest dome is 16 metres (52.5 feet) in diameter. The porch is positioned on four marble pillars, decorated with stalactite, and covered by three small domes. The interior is decorated and includes calligraphic inscriptions. The minaret of Mustafa Paşa Mosque, rising 42 metres (137.8  feet) is made of limestone.
Mustafa Pasha is buried in the hexagonal marble türbe covered by a dome above a short eight-sided tambour. Umi, one of his four daughters, is buried in the decorated sarcophagus which includes Persian inscriptions on two of the four walls. The mosque courtyard is filled with roses and, due to its elevated location, offers a distinct view of the Old Bazaar.

Church of the Holy Salvation
Constructed in the 19th century on the foundations of an older church, half of the church was built underground as it was illegal under Ottoman rule for Christian buildings to be taller than Islamic buildings so mosques could dominate the city skyline. The church got its present appearance in the 19th century.
The church's iconstasis was carved in wood and is 10 metres (32.8 feet) long, 4.5 to 7 metres (14.8 to 23 feet) in height.
Revolutionary Goce Delčev is buried in a white stone sarcophagus in the church's courtyard.

Stone Bridge
The Stone Bridge, across the Vardar River, connects the Old Bazaar to Macedonia Square in the new part of the city. The bridge, built in the 15th century under Sultan Murad, was built of stone blocks as its name suggests, which has helped it survive the fires and earthquakes Skopje has seen. The Stone Bridge has had the same appearance since it was first built.
The bridge has 12 semicircular arches and is 214 metres (702 feet) long. During Ottoman rule, countless executions were conducted on the Stone Bridge.

Suli Han
The Suli Han was built under Ishak Bey in the 15th century. It has two floors with the upper having 54 rooms for the guests and the lower for the guests' cattle. It was fully repaired after sustaining heavy damaged during the 1963 earthquake.
The han today houses the Skopje Academy of Art and the Old Bazaar Museum.

Sultan Murad Mosque
Sultan Murad built this mosque in 1463, just south of where the clock tower would be built. The mosque has remained mostly undamaged through the fires and earthquakes Skopje has sustained.
The Sultan Murad Mosque is rectangular in shape, with a porch including four columns with decorated caplets, connected by arcades.

Bit Pazar
Bit Pazar is part of the wider area of the Čaršija or Old Bazaar. Skopje's largest market, Bit Pazar is located next to the Old Bazaar proper and retained its multi-ethnic and multi-lingual environment where rural people come to sell farming produce and locals conduct business. During 2007-2008 a gate was built called the ""Ottoman door"" to separate the Čaršija and increase its individuality from Bit Pazar.

Skanderbeg Square
An existing statue of Skanderbeg, an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, is the main fixture of a square that bears his name located at the entrance to Skopje's Old Bazaar. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and was completed in 2018. The square covers 28,000 m2 (301,389 ft2) and extends from the Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the Old Bazaar. To accommodate construction a portion of the square was built on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty open space, the square contains an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.

65,Grand Bazaar (Ürümqi),"The Xinjiang International Grand Bazaar (simplified Chinese: 新疆国际大巴扎; traditional Chinese: 新疆國際大巴扎; pinyin: Xīnjiāng Guójì Dàbāzhā; Uyghur: شىنجاڭ خەلقئارا چوڭ بازىرى, romanized: Shinjang Xelq'ara Chong Baziri, Шинҗаң Хелқ'ара Чоң Базири), also known as International Grand Bazaar Xinjiang, is an Islamic bazaar in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, China.

67,Pondy Bazaar,"Pondy Bazaar, officially called Soundarapandianar Angadi, is a market and neighborhood located in T. Nagar, Chennai, India. It is one of the principal shopping districts of Chennai.

Etymology
The market Soundarapandianar Bazaar was named after Justice Party politician W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar whose statue is situated in the square. The police station in that area is officially called Soundarapandiyanar Angadi Kaval Nilayam.

Transport
Theyagaraya Road, which is the arterial road of Pondy Bazaar, suffers from slow-moving traffic. To ease the traffic, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai) has diverted buses going to the T. Nagar bus terminus that used to go via Pondy Bazaar. They now travel via the Thanikachalam Road-Burkit Road route. For some routes, such as the 47s and 11s, the buses occasionally go via Pondy Bazaar and occasionally via the diversion.
Private vehicles headed for the T. Nagar bus terminus or for Anna Salai (Saidapet and beyond) are strongly encouraged to either use the Thanikachalam Road route or Boag Road, rather than the Pondy Bazaar route, especially during rush hour.

Since the time of Shah Jahan, mughals reserved the pavilions with Balustered columns supporting the cusped arches only for the use of emperor and his immediate family, hence, it was likely built for Aurangzeb's personal use as summer retreat.
In 1775, the Maharaja of Patiala Amar Singh bought it from the King of Sirmur State Jagat Prakash.
English author-painter C.M. Villiers-Stuart, who resided in the gardens for a time, included a description in her book on ""Gardens of the Great Mughals"" (1913). She wrote:

""A quaint story still survives, how, when at length the work was finished, and Fadai came in state to spend his first summer there, his enjoyment of the garden and its beauties was short-lived; for the Rajas quickly frightened him away. In the districts round Pinjor, and in fact all along the foot of the Himalayas, occasional cases of goitre are to be seen; so from far and wide these poor people were collected by the wily Brahmins, and produced as the ordinary inhabitants of the place. The gardeners all suffered from goitre; every coolie had this dreadful complaint; even the countrywomen carrying up the big flat baskets of fruits and flowers to the zenana terraces were equally disfigured.
 The ladies of the harem naturally were horrified; it was bad enough to be brought into these wild outlandish jungles, without this new and added terror. For the poor coolie women, well instructed beforehand, had told how the air and water of Pinjor caused this disease, which no one who lived there long ever escaped. A panic reigned in the zenana; its inmates implored to be removed at once from such a danger; and finally, Fadai Khan had to give way, and take his ladies to some other place less threatening to their beauty.
 Had it been the terrible Emperor himself instead of his foster-brother, the cunning Rajas would have met their match. But Fadai Khan, thoroughly deceived, rarely came back to visit his lovely gardens, and the Rajas and their fields were left in peace for a time.""

This stratagem led to the abandonment of the garden by Mughals. Part of the walled outer enclosure of the abandoned garden was demolished in 1793 to build a road. The garden, covered with wild overgrowth, came under the territory ruled by the Maharaja of Patiala during the 19th century British Raj, who used the garden terraces to grow roses for making attar perfume for the maharaja. The Maharaja Yadavindra Singh (1914–74) of the princely state of Patiala restored the garden to its former splendour. In recent times, it has been renamed as Yadavindra Garden in his memory, used as a setting for filming Bollywood movies.

Architecture
Built in a similar style to Shalimar Bagh in Kashmir, the garden has been laid in seven terraces, with the main gate of the garden opening into the highest first terrace, which has a palace built in Rajasthani–Mughal style. It is called the “Shish Mahal” (palace of glass), which is adjoined by a romantic ""Hawa Mahal"" (airy palace). The second terrace with arched doorways has the ""Rang Mahal"" (painted palace). The third terrace has cypress trees and flowerbeds leading to dense groves of fruit trees. The next terrace has the ""Jal Mahal"" (palace of water) with a square fountain bed and a platform to relax. Fountains and tree groves are provided in the next terrace. The lowermost terrace has an open-air theatre, which is designed as a disc-like structure.

Pinjore Garden Site Museum
The garden and the temple complex laid in an open-air museum, set up by Haryana State Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, are integrated through well-laid-out and well-drained pathways to remove any water logging. The whole complex has been beautifully illuminated at night.

71,Burma Bazaar,"Burma Bazaar is a market run by Burmese refugees in Chennai, India. It is located at Parrys Corner and is one of the several unorganized or grey market shopping hubs of Chennai. The bazaar was set up in 1969 by the Government of Tamil Nadu. It is located just outside the Chennai Beach railway station, in the old financial district of the city at George Town. It is a row of about 200 shops that line either side of the road for about a kilometre.

History
Burma Bazaar was established by Burmese immigrants, who were Tamil refugees who fled Myanmar during the early 1960s. The government set aside land for the Tamil refugees returning from Burma during the 1960s. The bazaar is run by the Burma Tamizhar Marumalarchi Sangam, an association that has been set up to look after the interests of the traders since 1966.

The bazaar
The bazaar extends to about a kilometre along the Chennai Beach railway station. There are an estimated 200 shops in the bazaar. With several passengers coming out of the station every few minutes, the market appears busy all the time. It is estimated that over 100,000 people pass through this corridor every week.
Per 2017 estimates, there are over 600 shops in the bazaar employing over 5,000 people.
It had been listed as a notorious market between 2009 and 2017 by the USTR for selling various counterfeit goods and pirated media and software.

In media
Ayan, a 2009 Indian film, shows the operations of selling CDs, software, electronics, perfumes, and other goods in great detail. Other Indian films which make references to the market include Vattaram (2006) and Kacheri Arambam (2010).

74,Ima Market,"The Ima Market (Meitei: Ima Keithel; literally, Mothers' Market), also known as the Nupi Keithel (English: Women's Market) or the Khwairamband Keithel (English: Khwairamband Market), is a women-only market in the middle of Imphal in the Indian state of Manipur. It is the only market in the world run entirely by women. Inside the market, male shopkeepers and vendors are not allowed to sell anything. The Government of Manipur has announced that the male shopkeepers and vendors will be punished if their shops and vendors are found inside the market. It is a commercial center and a popular tourist attraction in the state of Manipur. It was established in the 16th century and hosts around 5,000–6,000 women vendors who sell a variety of products. Products such as vegetables, fruits, textiles, toys, fish, spices and utensils are available in the market. It is the largest all–women market in Asia.

History
The market was established in the 16th century following the imposition of the labour system, lallup-kaba in 1533 CE. The lallup-kaba was a forced labour system in Manipur Kingdom which required male members of the Meitei ethnicity to work in distant lands or to serve in the army. As a consequence of the system, women had to support their households by cultivating their fields or weaving textiles and then selling the products on improvised markets. The improvised markets led to the formation of the organized Ima Keithel. The Ima Keithel was the primary permanent market in Manipur until the 20th century.
In 1891, the British colonial administration attempted to impose economic and political reform in Manipur Kingdom, which disrupted the functioning of the market. The reforms involved large scale seizure and export of food corps from Manipur without consideration for local requirements which caused starvation at times of Mautam. It led to agitations by the women of the Ima Keithel and in response, the British attempted to sell off the assets and properties of Ima Keithel to foreigners and external buyers. This, among other causes, resulted in the Nupi Lan or the women's war, which eventually seized with the Japanese invasion of India.
Following independence, the market regained prominence as a commercial center and a hub of socio-political discussions. In 2010, the market was moved into the Khawairamband Bazaar complex constructed by the Municipal Corporation of Imphal. The complex had sustained damaged in the 2016 Imphal earthquake, which effected the livelihood of around 800 vendors.

Market
The Ima Keithel is located in the Khawairamband Bazaar Complex reconstructed on the site of Purana Bazaar in central Imphal. It is located west of Kangla Fort and on the Bir Tikendrajit Road in the Thangal Bazar locality. The complex consists of three large buildings with pagoda styled roofs. The market is split into two sections on either side of the road. Two buildings are located to the north of the main road and one to the south. Leimarel Shidabi Ima, or Purana Bazar, is the oldest and largest structure in the complex and Emoinu Ima Keithel, or Laxmi Bazar is the smallest structure in the complex, both are located to the north of main road. Phouoibi Ima Keithel, or the New Market, mainly sells handloom items, especially Meitei traditional clothes, that includes various phaneks, sarees, and inaphi, is located to the south of the road. The buildings are segregated into textile housing sections and household groceries sections. There is also a section of stalls under a large tin and tarp arrangement market to the east of the main buildings. In order to set up stalls in the main buildings of the market, an annual municipal fees is levied. The fee of a 16 square feet (1.5 m2) stall was ₹140,000 per annum at the time of construction in 2010. There is a licensing system in place for vendors with stalls. The market houses around 5000–6000 women vendors at any given day. As of 2017, the vendors at the market make an annual profit between ₹73,000 and ₹200,000. The annual turnover of the market was estimated to be between ₹40–50 Crore.

Management
The market is managed by a union of all the vendors of the market. It maintains a custom of only allowing women who have been married at least once to set up stalls. The women vendors include those who are divorced or have been widowed in the insurgency in Manipur. To be able to sell in the market, a new woman vendor needs to be referred by a retiring vendor. The vendors are primarily in the age of 45–70 years. The union also runs a credit system for lending to women traders.
Currently, Ima Mema Laishram and Ima Y Ibeyaima are the convenors of Khwairamband Ima Keithel Joint Coordinating Committee for Peace. Asem Nirmala is the General Secretary of Khwairamband Ima Keithel Lukmai Sellup.

Compliments
Minister of External Affairs of India, S Jaishankar called Ima market a ""great example of nari shakti (women's power) powering economic growth.""
In February 2023, delegates of B20 from the G20 forum visited the Ima Market. One of the delegates said, ""I will tell the world that there is a beautiful market run by women that sells suthentic handicrafts, clothes and others.""

A theory posits that name comes from the British living on the southern division of the Crawford Market (or Crawford Bazaar), who used to call the northern side of Crawford Market - ""behind the Bazaar"", which the local people started calling Bhindi or Bhendi Bazaar (phonetically similar to the Indian term for Okra - bhindi).

History
During the British Raj, Bhendi Bazaar was built as a labor camp for workers, engaged in the development of Bombay, to stay in. The buildings of the labor camp were later sold to private owners who in turn accommodated tenants based on the local pagri system.
As of 2011, the area is set to be revamped with the project being undertaken by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust initiated by Mohammed Burhanuddin, head of the Dawoodi Bohra community.

Demographics and culture
Bhendi Bazaar is primarily a Muslim-populated area, home to Muslims with origins in all parts of India, especially Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and northern India. Shop-owners and hawkers in this market belong to different religious groups.
Old streets like Saifee Jubilee Street, Khara Tank Road, Dhabu Street (now called Raudat Tahera Street), Pakmodia Street, Zainabia Marg, Tokra Gulli, 1st Cooper Street, 2nd Cooper Street, 3rd Cooper Street, and Chor Bazaar (consisting of Mutton Street and Chimna Butcher street) are populated by Bohri Muslims of the Dawoodi Bohra (a sect of Ismaili Shia Islam) among other Muslim sects.
The area houses Raudat Tahera, the mausoleum of the 51st and 52nd Dai-al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohras, Taher Saifuddin and Mohammed Burhanuddin. Bhendi Bazaar has the first two wing high-story tower of its own named Al-Saadah.
Bhendi Bazaar is famous for the food delicacies that it has to offer, it has been called 'A Glutton's Guide To Mumbai's Best Bohri Mohalla Food Joints'. A 2010 Bollywood film, Bhindi Bazaar, was shot in the area.
The famous Bollywood singer Mohammad Rafi lived in Bhendi Bazaar when he moved to Bombay from Lahore in the early 1940s. Rafi started his career in playback singing whilst living in a small apartment in Bhendi Bazaar.

It was one of the largest wholesale and retail markets in Hyderabad. Officially about 375 traders have business in the Monda Market. GHMC has stated that due to poor conditions and inadequate facilities, the existing structure is to be demolished and a new multi-storied complex was to be constructed in its place.

Architecture
The Monda Market is designed in the art deco style, with a clock tower overlooking the market. The old jail complex also known as Jail Khana which was built in 1826 and was used to lodge political prisoners during the pre-Independence era by Britishers is located adjacent to the market.

87,Chappan Dukan,"Chappan Dukan (Chhappan Dukan/56 Dukan) is a food and shopping Street located in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. It is known for its active street food scene and variety of shops, establishing itself as a notable landmark for residents and visitors alike.
Chappan Dukaan accommodates 56 food shops within a distance of approximately 200 meters, situated in the upscale Palasia area of Indore.

History
Until 1974, the area was referred to as the Udasin Ashram Market. It was a sparsely wooded region lacking specialized facilities. The local administration of Indore recognized the need for improvement. Consequently, a market was established for the vendors, consisting of 56 shops. This market was officially recorded in government records under the name Udasin Ashram Market. Vendors engaged in mobile businesses were allotted these shops at a cost of 2500 rupees each. The dimensions of these shops were a mere six by eight, allowing space for a handcart. During that period, the market primarily catered to the retail sale of items like vegetables. However, with time, new individuals acquired these shops and introduced a variety of offerings.
Between the 1980s and 1990s, the Chappan Dukan area became synonymous with Indore and earned the moniker ""56 Dukan"". In 2000, a major transformation took place which made widespread recognition across Madhya Pradesh and the nation. The market's popularity attracted celebrities, officials, and leaders, who frequently included it in their Indore visits, sometimes accompanied by their families.
In 2020, Chappan Dukan was redeveloped into a smart food street by Indore Smart City Development Limited (ISCDL), with the project costing approximately ₹4 crore (40 million rupees). The area has been designated a 'No Vehicle' zone.
Chappan Dukan has its own radio station, which was launched in 2022, catering to both shopkeepers and visitors. This marks the first instance of its kind in Madhya Pradesh, where 56 shops have their individual radio stations—a concept previously seen in malls of Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.
The Times of India reported in 2019 that the food shops at Chappan Dukan have reportedly contributed approximately 40% (estimated based on shopkeepers' statements) to the city's annual food market turnover of ₹5,000 crore.

Recognition
In September 2021, Chappan Dukan received an award from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for being a 'Clean Street Food' hub in Indore. It a FSSAI certified street food hub. In April 2022, Indore Smart City Development was awarded the First Prize for Chappan Dukan in the Built Environment category in the Smart Cities Conference held in Gujarat .

95,Chawri Bazar,"Chawri Bazar is a specialized wholesale market of brass, copper and paper products. Established in 1840, with a hardware market, it was the first wholesale market of Old Delhi it lies to the west of Jama Masjid in Delhi.

It can be reached by taking the street just near the middle projection of Jama Masjid's western (rear) wall. It was accessible via the Chawri Bazar underground station of the Delhi Metro.

History
Once popularly known for its dancing girls and courtesans in the 19th century, frequented by nobility and rich alike. After the advent of the British as the tawaif culture faded out, subsequently, prostitutes came to occupy the upper floors of the market. This eventually led to the area becoming a hub of criminality and thus the Delhi Municipal Committee evicted them from the area altogether, the street is named after a Marathi word chawri, which means meeting place. The street got this name mainly because here a 'sabha' or meeting would take place in front of a Maratha noble's house and he would try settling the disputes before it would reach the emperor. A second reason is probably that a gathering used to get organized when a respected dancer performed and showed the finer nuances of her skill. The whole ambience of the street, however, got changed after the 1857 war when the British destroyed many huge mansions of the Maratha nobles.
Built of Lakhori bricks, a small canon is placed over the gateways of both the buildings. The buildings have semi-octagonal projections on both sides with two small rooms on either side. The rooms have semi-circular arches to enter and it is difficult to visualize its former shape. The main features of the buildings are its niches and arches at the roof-level on the semi-octagonal projections, though difficult to make out.
Today, Chawri Bazaar is a very busy road as labourers with their laden backs, cars, rickshaws, scooters and walkers almost battle for the passage during the peak market hours. Again it is also a wholesale market but you will be allowed to purchase a brass or copper idol of Lord Vishnu, Buddha and others. The shops also keep many useful items like jewellery boxes, vases, pots and oil lamps. However, at present Chawri Bazar is more known as the wholesale market of paper products than copper or brass. From beautiful wedding cards to attractive wallpapers to nice greetings to any type of paper required for any use, everything is available here.
Chawri Bazar is a road which has Jama Masjid on one end and Hauz Quazi on the other end. Now, there is a metro station at Hauz Quazi by the name of Chawri Bazar. Nai Sarak, which is famous for Books and Ladies' Garments, joins it at Bad-shah Bulla. Besides Nai Sarak, there is another way through Ballimaran which connects Chawri bazar to Chandni Chowk.

96,"Sadar Bazaar, Delhi","Sadar Bazaar is the largest wholesale cosmetics jewellery market of household items in Old Delhi, Delhi, India. 
Like other major markets of Old Delhi, this market is very crowded and buzzes with activity. Although it is primarily a wholesale market, it also caters to occasional retail buyers. Owing to the sheer volumes that are traded here every day, a visit to the market can be termed sensory overload. In addition to being a market for traders, Sadar Bazaar is a assembly constituency, making it a hub for politics. Sadar Bazar is in the list of World's 9 Most Iconic Markets, as per Times Travel. Sadar Bazar market was developed in 1830 by the British officer Charles Trevelyan. Sadar Bazar is the largest wholesale market in Asia & India. 'Bara Tooti Chowk' in Sadar Bazar, is the main intersection in the market, where all the protest, functions/celebrations, meetings, etc. are done. Daily Business worth of ₹300crore is done on daily basis in the market.

History
Paharganj, also referred as Shahganj or King's ganj or market place during Mughal era, gets its present name 'Paharganj', literally meaning Hilly neighbourhood, owing to its proximity to the Raisina Hill, where the Rashtrapati Bhavan stand today. Till, 1857, neighbourhoods like Paharganj, Kishenganj, and Pahari Dhiraj, were separate pockets which in the following years grew and merged, for example Pahari Dhiraj merged into Sadar Bazaar.

Location and transportation
Sadar Bazaar is located on the western side of Khari Baoli street. It is connected to the rest of the city via buses (closest station is Kashmere Gate ISBT), auto-rickshaws and trains (closest metro station is Tis Hazari  Metro Station).
The area also has a railway station named Delhi Sadar Bazar (Code: DSB). It is 1 km (0.62 mi) from New Delhi railway station and trains take about 9 to 15 minutes to reach there. All the trains that stop here are either EMUs, MEMUs or passenger trains consisting of General class seating arrangements. As of 2015, the rail ticket fare for this leg is ₹5.

Commodities
Sadar Bazaar consists of numerous smaller markets, including Pratap market, Swadeshi market and Teliwara or Timber market. The market, as a whole, not only deals in household goods, but also in various other items such as toys, imitation jewellery and stationery. It has become a den of counterfeit products of many multi-national companies, FMCG products and especially cosmetic goods of deceptively similar character. It was thus listed as a ""notorious market"" by the USTR in 2015 for selling counterfeit consumer goods and cosmetics.
Traders and shoppers have access to authentic Indian food, including delicacies deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter) and mithai (traditional sweets) of various kinds. The lanes are plenty and narrow, lined with shops selling imported goods, clothing, shoes and leather items, electronic and consumer goods, and more. The market, even more so than the rest of the city, is very congested.

Concerns
Considered by some to be the biggest wholesale market in Asia, accounts from local traders indicate that Sadar Bazaar suffers from over-congestion of stalls, power cuts, lack of sanitation facilities, improper maintenance of roads and frequent traffic jams.
Despite being chaotic, Sadar Bazaar remains a tourist attraction.

Swadeshi Market
Swadeshi Market in Sadar Bazaar is famous for artificial jewellery, toys, gifts item, and household plastics. Inside Sadar Bazaar, every lane is having its local association and having shops of different goods.

Administration and politics
Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association (Regd.) is the parental organisation of all the major trade associations of Sadar Bazaar.
Sadar Bazaar is part of the Sadar-Paharganj constituency, one of the twelve administrative zones of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). As of 2015, this constituency is represented by Som Dutt of the Aam Aadmi Party. Prior to Dutt, this Vidhan Sabha constituency was represented by Rajesh Jain of the Indian National Congress (INC). Previously a parliamentary constituency, it is now a part of Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency represented by Harsh Vardhan of the BJP.

100,"Chor Bazaar, Mumbai","Chor Bazaar is one of the largest flea markets in India, located at Mutton street, near Bhendi Bazaar in Grant Road, South Mumbai. The area is one of the tourist attractions of Mumbai. The word ""chor"" means 'thief' in Marathi, Gujarati and Hindi. According to popular legend, if you lose anything in Mumbai you can buy it back from the Chor Bazaar.

Origin of name
Chor Bazaar, literally translated as Thieves' Market, was initially called Shor Bazaar, given how noisy things would get in the bustling and busy markets along the arterial Mohammed Ali Road. It is located just about a few kms away from Crawford Market in South Mumbai.
The market got called Chor Bazaar by the British who could not pronounce the word correctly. Eventually, stolen goods and vintage items made their way into the market and the name stayed.

History
Chor Bazaar in Mumbai emerged as one of the oldest markets of second-hand goods in India since the British rule in India. In modern times, it is said to sell mostly second-hand goods rather than stolen goods. The market is now famous for antique and vintage items.
A store called Mini Market offers old Bollywood posters for sale. Others offer authentic Victorian furniture, replacement parts for automobiles, etc. Although bargains are sometimes staggering, haggling is considered mandatory. This is basically an ""organized"" flea market, where one has to rummage through junk to find what one wants.
A popular story about the origin of the name of the market is that a violin and some other belongings of Queen Victoria went missing while being unloaded from her ship while on a visit to Bombay, and were later found for sale in the ""thieves' market"".

In popular culture
The market has been mentioned in popular novels, including Rohinton Mistry's Such a Long Journey, where it is described as ""not a nice place"". The Spool Man (2016) – a short documentary about a Chor Bazaar shop-keeper, directed by Daniel Ifans, produced by We Are Tilt. Official Selection at Ethnografilm Film festival 2019 (Paris, France).

101,Chaura Bazaar,"Chaura Bazaar, Ludhiana is the main and old market of the city. It is like a commercial hub of the Ludhiana.

History
Chaura Bazaar is an old market of 19th century. Some old building are still located in the streets of Chaura Bazaar. It was established on the bank of Sutlej River at Ludhiana. ""Chaura Bazaar"" literally means 'Wide Market'. Earlier days, market's streets were looking wide. So from this wide open streets its name become Chaura Bazaar. But according to in 21st century population streets are very narrow. It is difficult to take pass at daytime, and still people throng it. Every Sunday is a special and most busy day, just like Boxing Day. Monday mostly market go for off. There is a saying in Ludhiana that if a thing is not available anywhere it can be had from Chaura Bazaar only. The old Ludhiana city was confined to Chaura Bazaar, Daresi, Purana Bazaar and Ghas Mandi. Earlier people used to sell grass from Ghas Mandi. Today it may slightly look out of place, but the grass was an important commodity at that time since most of the transportation was done through horse driven carts and the horses were fed with grass only.

103,Chandni Chowk,"The Chandni Chowk is one of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi, India. It is located close to the Old Delhi Railway Station. The Red Fort monument is located at the eastern end of Chandni Chowk. It was built in the 17th century by the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, and designed by his daughter, Jahanara. The market was once divided by canals (now closed) to reflect moonlight. It remains one of India's largest wholesale markets.

History
The market's history dates to the founding of the capital city of Shahjahanabad when Emperor Shah Jahan established the Red Fort on the banks of the Yamuna River besides his new capital.

Original Chandni Chowk
The original Chandni Chowk, half-moon-shaped square, was located in front of the Municipal Townhall and its reflection used to shine in the moonlit water pool located in front of it. A shallow water channel was built from Yamuna, which ran through the middle of the straight road currently known as the Chandani Chowk bazaar, with roads and shops on either side of the channel. This road had three bazaars. Chandni Chowk, or the Moonlight Square, and its three bazaars were designed and established by Princess Jahanara Begum, Shah Jahan's favourite daughter, in 1650 CE. Originally containing 1,560 shops, the bazaar was 40 yards wide by 1,520 yards long. The bazaar shaped as a square was given elegance by the presence of a pool in the centre of the complex. The pool shimmered in the moonlight, a feature which was responsible for its name. Shops were originally built in a half-moon shaped pattern, now lost. The bazaar was famous for its silver merchants, which also have contributed to the name of ""Silver Street"" as silver is referred to as Chandi in Hindi, a slight variation of which forms Chandni.
The pool in the chowk was replaced by a clock tower (Ghantaghar) in the 1870s. The centre of the market is still referred to as Ghantaghar. Chandni Chowk was once the grandest Indian market. Mughal imperial processions passed through Chandni Chowk. The tradition was continued when the Delhi Durbar was held in 1903. Delhi Town Hall was built in 1863 by the British.

Original three bazaars
The term Chandni Chowk originally referred only to the square that had a reflecting pool. Now the whole straight road which runs through the middle of the walled city, from the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid is called Chandni Chowk. The road was then divided into three following bazaars:

Urdu Bazar: Lahori Gate of the Mughal royal palace to Chowk Kotwali near Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib was called Urdu Bazaar, i.e., the encampment market. The Urdu language received its name from this encampment. Ghalib noted the destruction of this market during the disturbances of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and its aftermath.
Johri Bazar: Chowk Kotwali to Chandni Chowk (location of now demolished Ghantaghar, presently in front of Municipal/Town Hall) section of the straight road was originally called Johri Bazar.
Fatehpuri Bazar: 'Chandni Chowk' to Fatehpuri Masjid section of the straight road was originally called the Fatehpuri Bazar.
Now choked with congestion, the market retains its historical character.

Kucha, katra and havelis
The road now called Chandni Chowk had several streets running off it which were called kuchas (streets/wings). Each Kucha usually had several katras (cul de sac or guild houses), which in turn had several haveli's. The following terms are generally used to describe the buildings and the streets:

Mohalla (neighborhood): is a residential neighbourhood with Kuchas and Kartras within Kuchas.
Kucha or Gali (street): Kucha in the Persian language is synonymous with ""Gali"" or street in the Hindi language. It is a street or a zone with houses whose owners shared some common attributes, usually their occupation. Hence the names Kucha Maliwara (the gardeners' street) and Kucha Ballimaran (the oarsmen's street). Kuchas either had rows of large Havelis or gated cul de sac (dead end) ""Katra"" marketplaces along with them.
Kucha mahajani: is one of the biggest gold-trading hubs and wholesale jewellery markets in Asia.
Katra (gated cul-de-sac courtyard market-cum-residential complex in a street): are one-room quarters around a court with a single narrow entrance and inhabited by people of the same caste or occupation i.e. a zone with houses whose owners shared some common attribute, usually their occupation, hence the name. Katra refers to a separate wing of tradesmen and craftsmen belonging to the same trade. They usually lived and worked together in a gated cul de sac, the doors of which could be closed at night for the protection of the merchandise, equipment, workers and their families. It is a system similar to the guild housing in Amsterdam such as Handboogdoelen and Voetboogdoelen.
Haveli (mansion): A normal haveli has a big courtyard (atrium) surrounded on four sides by spacious rooms and often another walled courtyard around the exterior.  Historic havelis include:
Begum Samru's palace built in 1806, now called Bhagirath Palace, see.
Dharampura Haveli, Gali Guliyan, designed in late Mughal style although parts show the influence of 20 Century architecture. During Mughal and late Mughal Period, a large numbers of Havelis were built by courtiers. With increasing interest in Old Delhi by tourists, and to revive the old world charm of Purani Dilli, Haveli Dharmpura houses an Indian restaurant serving specialities of Mughal era with a contemporary touch, which you can enjoy with classical dance.
Chunnamal haveli in Katra Neel
Ghalib ki Haveli of Mirza Ghalib, Gali Qasim Jan (Gali Ballimaran)

Haveli Naharwali, Kucha Sadullah Khan, where Pervez Musharraf, former president of Pakistan was born and his grandfather sold it to Prem Chand Gola after whom this area is now called Gola Market. This was originally owned by the Raja Nahar Khan a Hindu convert of Mewat who converted to Islam during the era of Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1355, hence the name.
Khazanchi haveli, the Khajanchi were the accountants of Shah Jahan. A street is named after them called ""Gali Khajanchi"", a long tunnel connects the haveli and the Red Fort, so that money could be transferred safely. It is close to the entrance of Chandni Chowk, from the Red Fort walk towards Fatehpuri, turn left on road to Dariba and the haveli is at the end of the road that connects Dariba and Esplanade Road.
Haveli Raja Jugal Kishore, a grand mansion with an imposing gate, which was adorned with a large ghanta-bell. Located adjacent to the gate, a room in the haveli opening towards the street, was given to Lala Sukhlal by the owners of the haveli as a philanthropic gesture to open a sweet shop, which came to be identified as ghante ke neechewala halwaii. (see Ghantewala). A street is named after the haveli; Kucha-i-Haveli Raja Jugal Kishore between Kucha Maliwara and Kotwali Chabutra.
Naughara Mansions in Naughara Gali off Kinari Bazaar has 18th century Jain mansions. It is a street with nine (nau) continuous havelies with brightly painted floral designs on the facade. Each of the havelies used to have a gharha (water pot) placed at door for the thirsty passersby.

Office of Atma Prakash Aggrawal at the beginning of the street houses numerous antiques and should not be mistaken as an antique shop.

Present Building was however built later in 1930.
The Sunehri Masjid was built in 1721 by Roshan-Ud-Daula Zafar Khan in the reign of Mohammad Shah. Persian invader Nader Shah spent several hours on the top of the mosque on 11 March 1739 to observe the Katl-e-Aam (the killing of everyone in sight) that he had ordered, which resulted in 30,000 deaths.

Redevelopment
Chandni Chowk was redeveloped as heritage trail to promote tourism getting inspiration from Heritage Street Amritsar. Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation, under the auspices of the Government of the NCT of Delhi, is the agency carrying out this task. The redevelopment plan includes footpaths to make the area more pedestrian-friendly for a large number of shoppers and visitors. No motorized traffic will be allowed on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid in the day time. Roads are also planned to be decongested and some will be barricaded. People who want to come there will have to use the Ebus. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the 2010 Commonwealth Games but has been delayed for various reasons. Delhi government is now pushing it seriously. The redevelopment plan is being implemented under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. The Plan also includes extra parking for 1500 cars.
As a part of the redevelopment, a multilevel parking cum commercial complex is coming up at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk. The project was inaugurated by Union minister of science and technology, Dr. Harshvardhan.
This multilevel parking cum commercial complex would be an eight-storeyed building with three basements covering 18,524 square meter area at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore on a PPP model with a Leading Real estate developer Omaxe. The project that has a capacity to accommodate over 2,300 cars.

106,Khan Market,"Khan Market is a shopping district and retail market in New Delhi, India. It was established in 1951 by the newly constituted Republic of India's Rehabilitation Ministry to give economic opportunities to refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province in Pakistan.  Many such refugees had arrived in the Delhi region.  It is named after Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, also known as Dr. Khan Sahib, who was the Chief Minister of NWFP from 1945 to 1947, and who had helped many refugees to escape without harm.  Khan was the elder brother of the Pashtun- and Indian-freedom activist Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan (""Frontier Gandhi""). In 2019, Khan Market was rated as the world's 20th most expensive commercial street by Cushman & Wakefield.

History
Established in 1951, the U-shaped, double-storey market complex originally had 154 shops and 74 flats on the first floor for shopkeepers. Many of these shops were allocated as seed land to immigrants from the North-West Frontier Province after the partition of India, Khan Market is named in honor of Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan , a Pashtun political and spiritual leader.
Nearby is Sujan Singh Park, New Delhi's first apartment complex, built in 1945, and designed by Walter Sykes George and named after the grandfather of this enclave's most famous resident, writer Khushwant Singh. George also designed, the Ambassador Hotel next door, built in 1945 in a mix of British and Art Deco style. The building is now a heritage property and the hotel has been taken over by the Taj Vivanta chain.
Until the 1980s, all the flats on the first floor continued to serve as homes. Neighbourhood grocery stores and middle-class shops existed in the middle lane, despite the fact it catered most up to upmarket Golf Links, Sundar Nagar, and diplomatic crowd from Chanakyapuri. Gradually, the real estate boom and expanding families of the first generation of occupants forced many families to move out. Thus these homes were sold and started being converted into shops. By the 2010s, only a few families were living in these two-room flats.
A 2011 Cushman & Wakefield survey ranked Khan Market as the world's 21st most expensive shopping street.

Overview
Today it has grown to become one of the most expensive commercial real estate locations in the city. It has a wide variety of stores, including modern showrooms of most of well-known brands, silver jewellery stores, delicatessens, bookstores, paints and hardware stores, electronics, kitchenware, and fabric stores mingle with some of the better restaurants.
It is also famous for food including kebabs   and gol guppe (a type of popular street food) and a retail market for lighting fixtures on the ground floor. There are several bookstores in the market

Location
Khan Market is almost in the heart of the city, close to India Gate. It is surrounded by residential complexes — government owned and private — including Golf Links, Lodhi Estate, Shahjahan Road, Pandara Road, Rabindra Nagar and Sujan Singh Park. Its environs are home to a significant number of bureaucrats from the central government (including some MPs from both the houses), and famous people like the satirist Khushwant Singh. It is one of the greenest pockets of the city, very close to the famed Lodhi Gardens. Also in proximity are the India International Centre, the India Habitat Centre, offices of the World Wide Fund for Nature, and other organizations. Nearby the Khan Market are popular schools such as Sardar Patel Vidyalaya and The Raghubir Singh Junior Modern School.

Transport
It is serviced by the Khan Market underground station of the Delhi Metro (Violet Line), which lies in front of the Taj Vivanta Hotel. There are four exits of the metro station namely Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3 and Gate 4. The exit at Gate 4 leads to Khan Market.

107,Urdu Bazaar,"The Urdu Bazaar (literally, 'Urdu market') is a major market in the walled city of Delhi, India that connected the canal in the middle of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid. The original market was destroyed in the aftermath of Indian Rebellion of 1857, but its name survives as a location near the Jama Masjid.
The Urdu language obtained its name from this market.
Ghalib lamented on the destruction of Delhi in the aftermath of the failure of the 1857 rebellion: ""My dear man, when Urdu Bazaar is no more, where is Urdu? By God, Delhi is no more a city, but a camp, a cantonment. No Fort, no city, no bazaars, ...""
Delhi's first Chief Executive Councillor and noted freedom fighter, Mir Mushtaq Ahmad, was a resident here prior to and during his term in office and founded the Janata Cooperative Bank in Urdu Bazaar in 1956 for the benefit of local businesses and residents. His premises also hosted periodic meetings of nationally reputed poets and intellectuals.
Today, the main book publishing, printing and selling markets of the Pakistani cities such as Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi are also known as Urdu Bazaar.

108,Palika Bazaar,"Palika Bazaar,  is an underground market located between the inner and outer circle of Connaught Place, Delhi, India. It is named after Palika Bazaar of Mumbai. Palika Bazaar hosts 380 numbered shops selling a diverse range of items; however, the market is dominated by electronic items and clothing. Palika Bazaar was set up in 1979,but since the 1990s it has seen a decline in customers. 
Palika Bazaar is estimated to have some 15,000 people within its confines at any given time and also attracts many foreign tourists. It is known for its reasonably priced items and is a famous tourist attraction. It also has a reputation for a wide availability of illegal products such as pornography, stolen goods, fake designer products and unlicensed CDs, software and movies. Police conduct regular raids to recover stolen or counterfeit merchandise, but this has failed to put an end to the illegal activity in the market.
It has been listed as a notorious market since 2009 by the USTR for being an underground market with large amounts of counterfeit products including pirated software and media.

Security Problems
After the rape of a female shopper by two shopkeepers in April 2007, Delhi Police advised women against entering Palika Bazar alone. Local media reported that female visitors often complain about eveteasing and harassment, and a lack of proper trial rooms.

""Regeneration"" Project
As part of a wider effort, the New Delhi Municipal Council is currently working on plans for a major ""regeneration of Palika Bazaar"", described to be in a state of decay.

109,"Aminabad, Lucknow","Amina Hamza Bazaar is one of the oldest market centers in the city of Lucknow along with Chowk, Nathan's and Hazratganj. Its traders and shops are involved in both wholesale and retail commerce. The main commodities and goods traded are clothes, Chikan embroidery work, spices, dry snacks, hosieries and wedding decorations. In fact, Aminabad is a combination of various markets, cluster of houses, offices and is often compared to the bustling Chandni Chowk of Delhi.
It still has his importance in the Lucknow market and is still the pillar of Lucknow markets. Aminabad is known for the efforts of Vedanta Singh.

History
The year the marketplace came into being is not clear. But by all accounts, it was during the rule of the Nawab that the market got its present basic form and name.
According to the most credible version of history, the land on which Aminabad stands belonged to Rani Jai Kunwar Pandey. The Rani, besides being a vassal of the Mughals, was also a great associate of Khadija Khanam's, the Begum (wife) of the first Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk, who was also the Grand-Wazir of the Mughal Empire.
The Rani constructed a Mosque on the mentioned land of Aminabad, and gifted it to her good ally, the wife of the Nawab. This 18th-century Mosque, known as Padain Ki Masjid (The Brahmin Woman's Mosque), still currently stands in Aminabad to this day. The Maqbara of Begum Khadija Khanam was also constructed in front of the masjid, but since has been lost to the vagaries of time, though the grave is still merely visible.
By the time the Nawabs moved their court from Faizabad to Lucknow, the site had become the center of activity and irregular commerce. It was a part of the city known as Masarratganj. The actual land on which Aminabad later was built on had passed under the possession of Sikandar Shikoh, a son of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. After the death of Sikandar Shikoh his wife became custodian of the property in Masarratganj and she sold it for Rs.2800/- to Nawab Imdad Husain Khan Aminuddaulah, who was the Prime Minister of Nawab Amjad Ali Shah, the fourth Nawab of Lucknow. This was around the 1840s.
Aminuddaulah was a visionary, who took upon the task of metamorphosing the area into a developed zone. Over the following years, concrete houses, shops and parks replaced the thatched huts and ramshackle shelters in the open fields. Traders, craftsmen and entertainers were encouraged to set up their establishments there.
Four gates had been erected on all four sides, and each gate had an adjoining mosque. The biggest gate, known as ""Kalaan Phatak"" was at the main crossing. The mosque near it was also called ""Kalaan Phatak Masjid"". Towards the west was the smaller Khurd Gate near Mehra Cinema on Gwynne Road. The gates no longer exist, but the mosques are still intact and are known by their original names. Aminuddaulah also initiated the construction of a big park in the area within the rows of the newly opened shops during this timespan.
After the revolt of 1857, the rule of the Nawabs came to an end and the Aminabad came under British rule. After the mutiny of 1857, the entire area came under the rule of the British. Later in 1905, Lt. Governor Sir Sir James Latouche, visited Aminabad and ordered its renovation. It was then that Latouche Road leading to this market came into existence and to date is called so. The renovated Aminabad was inaugurated by Sir Latouche himself in 1911.
Meanwhile, Babu Ganga Prasad Varma came to live in Aminabad in 1910 and designed the market with big corridors, so that roads could be used for walking. Ganga Prasad Memorial Hall was built by him for public functions. He was the one who came up with the idea of constructing Goonge Nawab Park.
In 1912 the British government made a master plan for this area and, as per the plan, roads on all four sides of this park were laid out and the park came to be known as Aminuddaulah Park. In the following years, the importance and stature of Chowk and Nakhkhas bazaar started receding and Aminabad gained ascendancy, and Aminuddaulah Park became not only the talk of the town but the nation itself. In 1928 it was at this park where during the struggle for independence the freedom fighters first hoisted the tri-colour. That eventful day was followed by the address to the nation by Mahatma Gandhi for the civil disobedience movement. Many more leaders including Jawahar Lal Nehru, Atal Bihari Bajpayee and Subhash Chandra Bose gave fiery speeches for independence at this platform.
The huge congregation that had gathered at Aminuddaulah Park to listen to Jawahar Lal Nehru was brutally lathi-charged by the British force and several people, including Nehru, got hurt. Gulab Singh Lodhi had climbed up a tree in the park and hoisted the tri-colour flag. The British police shot him down and later on his statue was installed in the centre of the park and still stands there. The park by now had acquired the name of Jhandewala Park because flags of various Indian political parties fluttered here.
Prior to independence, the literati of the city had made Aminabad their place of dwelling and they eagerly awaited the leading Indian newspapers like Humdum, Haqeeqat and Pioneer each morning. Newspaper vendors would come to the main crossing early morning and their wares were sold until late evening. The writers, poets and educationists even then frequented Danish Mahal in the ground floor of Central Hotel, and the nearby Siddiq Book Depot and Anwar Book Depot. There was a time when at these erudite centres one could have come across the likes of Syed Masood Hasan Rizvi, Dr. Shujaat Ali Sandilavi, Josh Malihabadi, Prof. Ehtesham Husain, Nawab Mirza Jafar Ali Khan ‘Asar’, Majaz and many more. The owner of Danish Mahal, Nasim Ahmad, who died recently, was not only well-conversant with all kinds of books, but was also familiar with the persona and wherewithal of the stalwarts of the town.
Since the time of Nawabs, the market boasts of its unmatched fashion, and being one of the oldest markets, it is still surrounded by buildings and architectures of nawabi era.

Among the less wide streets of the nawabi times, the market shows off a wide variety of products on sale. In spite of being congested at times, Aminabad is a colorful, vibrant and lively market to shop, with products ranging from gold and silver to jewelry and ornaments, chikan kurtas to fancy sarees loaded with embroidery, from Lucknawi paan (betel leaves) to bakeries.

110,Surajkund,"Surajkund is an ancient reservoir of the 10th century located on Southern Delhi Ridge of Aravalli range in Faridabad city of Haryana state about 8 km (5 mi) from South Delhi. Surajkund (literally 'Lake of the Sun') is an artificial Kund ('Kund' means ""lake"" or reservoir) built in the backdrop of the Aravalli hills with an amphitheatre shaped embankment constructed in semicircular form. It is said to have been built by the king Surajpal of the Tomara Rajputs in the 10th century. Tomar, a younger son of Anangpal Tomar – the Rajput ruler of Delhi, was a sun worshipper and he had therefore built a Sun temple on its western bank. Surajkund is known for its annual fair ""Surajkund International Craft Mela"", 2015 edition of this fair was visited by 1.2 million visitors including 160,000 foreigners with more than 20 countries participating in it.
There are 43 paleolithic sites (100,000 BC), with rock art and microlithic stone tools, scattered surround the Surajkund from Mangar Bani in the west to Tuglaqabad in the northeast.
It is an important biodiversity area within the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor stretching from Sariska Tiger Reserve to Delhi. Historical place around sanctuary are Badkhal Lake (6 km northeast), Anangpur Dam (16 km north), Damdama Lake, Tughlaqabad Fort and Adilabad ruins (both in Delhi), Chhatarpur Temple (in Delhi). It is contiguous to the seasonal waterfalls in Pali-Dhuaj-Kot villages of Faridabad, the sacred Mangar Bani and the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. There are several dozen lakes formed in the abandoned open pit mines in and around the area. Surajkund falls inside the leopard habitat.
Another 'kund' by the same name as 'Suraj Kund' existed in Sunam in Punjab, which was sacked by Mahmood Ghaznvi or Taimur Lane, consequently now lies in ruins.

Location
Surajkund is located near the Surajkund village between the villages of Badarpur and Lakkarpur in Faridabad district of Haryana. It is 8 kilometres (5 mi) by road from South Delhi and 20 kilometres (12 mi) from the heart of the New Delhi city. It is well connected to all parts of the city. The nearest airport is the Indira Gandhi International Airport, 25 km (16 mi) away. The nearest railway stations are the New Delhi Railway Station and the Nizamuddin Railway Station, 22 kilometres (14 mi) and 21 kilometres (13 mi) respectively by road. It is also approached by road and rail from Faridabad (headquarters of the district) and Gurgaon cities. It is 11.5 kilometres (7 mi) from the Qutub Minar and 3 kilometres (2 mi) Tughlaqabad, two historical.

History
Paleolithic era (100,000 BP)
In the forested area where the Surajkund and the Anagpur Dam are located, ancient Stone Age relics have been found which are microliths (stone tools) belonging to lower paleolithic era. These were found at 43 sites from Ankhir (a village 17 km east of Mangar Bani) in south to north along Anangpur-Angnpur Dam-Surajkund-Tughlaqabad axis. These sites are on the 'Tughlaqabad-Surajkund Road' and south of 'Surajkund-Faridabad Road', on Anangpur hills, and on Ankhir hill, and on the road embracing the low ridge from Faridabad (Ankhir) to Surajkund. From a study of the prehistoric findings along the ridges of Surajkund reservoir, Anagpur Dam, and around Delhi and adjoining parts of Haryana, it has been inferred that the southern hilly area of Delhi and Haryana was environmentally suited for pre-historic man to settle here.
Paleolithic tools, rock paintings and rock art found in 2021 at various sites scattered inside the Mangar Bani might be extension of Anangpur-Surajkund paleolithic sites.

Medieval history
According to Hindu hagiography, the Dilli Mahatam, the Surajkund was earlier known as the Prabhashkund where sage Vishwamitra used to live, pray and worship.

Tomara dynasty (8th - 11th century CE)
Anangpal I, first king of Tomara dynasty (c.736- 1052 CE), declared himself an independent ruler and established the Tomar Rajputs of Delhi in the early 8th century. He built his capital in this village and expanded his kingdom from there. He is said to have built numerous palaces and temples during his reign, the majority of which are diminished now.
Last king of this dynasty was Anangpal Tomar (Anangpal II), who had built Delhi's Lal Kot, which was later renovated by Chauhan ruler and also came to be known as the Qila Rai Pithora. Tomara dynasty were overthrown by another Rajput dynasty, the Chahamanas of Shakambhari. The last Chahamana or Chauhan king was Prithviraj Chauhan  (the second last Hindu king of Delhi), Qila Rai Pithora (earlier called Lal Kot) was renamed after him.
The capital of Tomars changed a few times during the course of 457 years they ruled in the northern India. The first capital of the Tomar empire was Anangpur while the last one was Dhillikapuri (Delhi, Lal Kot).
Though historians have not specifically alluded to this tank, it is also said that it was built in 686 AD by Suraj Pal (after whom the tank is probably named) son of Anang Pal I. It is in the form of a segment (semi circular) with the chord on its west side. Another theory for the name 'Suraj' suffixed to the kund (lake) is that it was named after the Sun Temple that existed on the east side of the lake. Archaeological excavations have revealed existence of a Sun temple here based on ruins that can be seen even now. Certain carved stones were recently recovered from the reservoir. Some stones have also been re–used in subsequent restoration works. Historians also claim it was named after King Surajpal himself who built it. It is also said that Suraj Pal built this lake for his daughter.

Chauhan dynasty (12th century CE)
The Tomara's rule was followed by that of the Chahamanas and the mlechchha Sahavadina (Shihab ad-Din).

Sultanate era renovation (1351–88 CE)
During the Tughlaq Dynasty rule of Feroz Shah Tughlaq (1351–88), the reservoir was refurbished by rebuilding the steps and terraces with stones in lime mortar. On the western bank of the reservoir, a garhi (cave like structure) was built close to the ancient site of the Sun temple.

Post-independence of India (1947 onward)
Even though the Tomar dynasty vanished in the 12th century, the Surajkund has not been affected. It attracted the attention of the Haryana Government to develop the area as a tourist spot by introducing an annual crafts 'Mela' or ""fair"" titled ""Surajkund Crafts Mela"" in the precincts of the lake, which over the years has attracted wide publicity and become an iconic event.

Surajkund
Architecture of Surajkund
The reservoir has been built in the shape of the rising sun with an eastward arc. It is enclosed within a steep embankment made in semi-circular shape made of stepped stones. Rain fall was intercepted here to create a reservoir of 130 m (427 ft) diameter to meet the water shortage in Delhi. It has an area of 40 ha (99 acres). The reservoir provides a grand spectacle, and in the past it was the hunting forest resort. It abounds in dancing peacocks. The reservoir is filled up during every monsoon season but remains dry during summer, before the onset of the monsoon rains. The tank underwent major repairs in the 1920s during the British times.

Anagpur Dam
Anagpur Dam, constructed in 8th century, is 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) upstream of Surajkund in the north west. A seasonal stream flows from Anagpur Dam to Surajkund.

Peacock lake
Peacock lake, downstream and southwest of Surajkund, is delightfully beautiful.

Surajkund International Crafts Mela
In the backdrop of the lake, during the spring season, every year from 1–15 February, (in 2018, it is from 2-18 February) a colourful traditional craft festival of India is held on 40 acres of land in the precincts of Surajkund which is attended by all states of India along with several dozen other nations and over 1.2 million visitors including 200,000 foreigners. This fair was first started in 1987. Traditional craftsmen (artists, painters, weavers and sculptors) from all parts of the country participate in this annual celebration named as the ""Surajkund Crafts Mela"" or ""Surajkund designer's Village"". Designer items created by 50 best designers and craftsmen in wood, metal, bamboo, iron, glass, textiles and stone can be seen here. This Mela (fair) is visited by lovers of arts and crafts from all over the world. The fair is held with a different theme every year on Indian culture and crafts.
The theme, specific to a state of India, is depicted at the entrance to the Mela grounds and provides an ambience of that particular state with characteristic colors, materials, architecture, furniture and decorations. The crafts on display in the stalls (400) is of particular crafts of that state. The Mela also includes a food festival covering some of the popular cuisines from different parts of the country. Entertainment in the form of famous rhythms and dance of folk theatre are also held here during the festival.
During 2009, with Madhya Pradesh as the theme state, 50 crafts' persons from SAARC countries, Thailand and Egypt also participated in the Mela. The show was titled ""Hemvati-Khajuraho"" as a part of the 23rd annual Surajkund Crafts Fair event. Sanchi Stupa, (a world heritage site in Madhya Pradesh) formed the backdrop for the festival. 2015 edition of fair was visited by 1.2 million visitors including 160,000 foreigners. In 2016 edition China will be participating in the fair as a part of agreement signed between India and China to celebrate 2016 as ""Year of China in India"".

Concerns and conservation
Ban on illegal mining
Supreme Court of India, put an end to the illegal mining in the area around Surajkund which was causing ecological disaster and rapid depletion of ground water in the Aravalli hill range between Tughlaqabad and Gurugram via Surajkund. Supreme Court has asked the Haryana Government ""to stop all mining activities and pumping of groundwater within a (5 kilometres (3 mi)), radius of the Delhi-Haryana border in the Haryana Ridge and in the Aravali hills.""

Damage to the catchment area
The storage in the upstream Anangpur Dam, downstream Surajkund and Peacock lake has been seriously affected The catchment area which contributes water flows into the Surajkund (lake) from villages, such as Anangpur, Lakkarpur, Ankhir and Meola Maharajpur, has been used for extensive mining and for large habitations. This has disturbed the drainage system and thus obstructed the gravity flow of rain water from the basin into the reservoir. This has also affected the flora and fauna of the area. The Surajkund lake's drainage basin is part of the Aravalli hill ranges. It is fed from the north western side by a local nullah (stream) that initially feeds the Anagpur dam on the upstream, this dam was built by Samrat Anangpal Tomar.

Leopard corridor
Surajkund falls inside the leopard habitat of Delhi and Haryana which often get killed due to being hit by the vehicles on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road as there is no wildlife crossing underpass or overpass.

Wetland rehabilitation

112,Zaibunnisa Street,"Zaibunnisa Street or Elphinstone Street (former name) (Urdu: زیب النساء اسٹریٹ), is a thoroughfare and a shopping center in central Karachi, Pakistan that courses through Saddar, the city's colonial-era commercial centre. 
It is believed to have been renamed after Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah, Pakistan's first woman editor and publisher, in 1970. However, some historians argue it was renamed after the Mughal princess Zeb-un-Nissa.

History
The road was founded as Elphinstone Street and was named after Mountstuart Elphinstone, the first British ambassador to Afghanistan who also played a vital role in defeating the Maratha Empire. It used to be one of the most prestigious shopping areas in Karachi before the newly built shopping malls in the suburban areas of Karachi were built from the 1980s onwards. Zaibunnisa Street now is known for having a huge number of watch, clock and jewelry shops, large clothing stores for women and men, as well as shoe stores.

Route
Zaibunnisa Street begins at Garden Square - the point at which it intersects with Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road (former name is Bunder Road). From there, it courses south, first intersecting with Castle Street near the Brooks Memorial Church. From there, it passes Price Street near Jahangir Park and intersects with Preedy Street. It then enters the central part of Saddar, where it is lined with several heritage buildings. Going south, it intersects with Hale Street in Bohri Bazaar, Albert Street, Woodburn Street, Parr Street, Shahrah-e-Iraq, Dundass Street, Blenken Street, before ending at Sarwar Shaheed Street. From there, it continues south as Fatima Jinnah Street towards Civil Lines.

113,American Market,"American Market (also known as Sitara Market) is a market located in Peshawar, Pakistan. It sells various types of electronic goods and is notorious for giving its visitors the opportunity to purchase various firearms and accessories.
According to a local dealer, ""the area has come to be known as the American Market because it sells US goods that have either been stolen and transported from Afghanistan, or from trucks captured from NATO transporting goods from Pakistan to Afghanistan."" Even though being nicknamed the ""American Market"", this market sells ""arms from the US, China, Russia, Iran and just about every other country you can think of"".
After the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021), the supply of contraband to the market has dwindled. As a result, the number of customers visiting it has significantly decreased.

114,Qissa Khwani Bazaar,"The Qissa Khwani Bazaar (Pashto: قصه خوانۍ بازار, Urdu: قصہ خوانی بازار; ""Story-tellers market) is a bazaar in Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

Background
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (then North-West Frontier Province) province Gazetteer, traveller Lowell Thomas and Peshawar's British commissioner Herbert Edwardes called it ""the Piccadilly of Central Asia"".

History
On 23 April 1930, British Indian Army troops opened fire on a crowd of anti-colonial protestors at the Qissa Khwani Bazaar, killing nearly 400 people.  The colonial authorities ultimately acknowledged that the British Indian Army had killed 179 people in the massacre, which triggered protests across India and catapulted the newly formed Khudai Khidmatgar movement into prominence.
In 2010, 25 people were killed in a bomb attack at a protest against electricity shortages. The market was again targeted by militants in 2013, who used a 220 kg bomb to carry out an attack that killed over 40 people, and damaged a nearby mosque as well as set fire to several historic wooden buildings.
On 4 March 2022, 63 people were killed and 196 others wounded in a suicide attack at a mosque during Jumma prayer.
Kissa Khwani Bazaar is famous for Chai and Qehwa houses, and also because several famous Indian movie actors have origins and family ties in the region. Indian film actor Dilip Kumar was born in Qissa Khwani Bazaar on or about 11 December 1922. He belonged to Awan family. Actor Raj Kapoor and his uncle, actor Trilok Kapoor were also born in the area. Actor Shah Rukh Khan's family still lives in the area.

History
The bazaar was established in 1633 and is located in Lahore Fort near Naulakha Pavilion. The Shaheed Ganj Mosque is located in Naulakha Bazaar. The used clothing and crockery bazaar, landa bazaar, is also located near Naulakha Bazaar.
When the Naulakha Pavilion was built in 1633 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a small summer house, it cost around 900,000 rupees, an exorbitant amount at the time. It is called Naulakha because in Punjabi language, the word means 'worth 9 lakhs rupees'. This also brought the word Naulakha into common use to signify something precious.

117,Paan Gali,"Paan Gali (Punjabi: پان گلی, Urdu: پان گلی) is a bazaar in Lahore, Pakistan that is known for selling goods imported from India. It is located within Anarkali Baazaar and comprises three lanes and around fifty shops.
Paan Gali became a centre of selling Indian goods after the partition of India in 1947.
Vendors in the market sell paan, sarees, coconuts, beauty products, ayurvedic medicines, and kitchen utensils. Rafiq Abbas, a local shopkeeper of Paan Gali, has described the popularity of the locality:

I believe after Indian movies and movie stars, Indian embroidered cloth particularly sarees are most popular item in here. People from Karachi, Quetta and far-off places in Punjab come to the Paan Gali to buy kamdani, jamawar, banarsi, kataan, chikan, etc type of cloths that are considered rich in texture and unique in quality...
Paan Gali is said to bear a resemblance to Chandni Chowk of Delhi.

120,Anarkali Bazaar,"Anarkali Bazaar (Punjabi, Urdu: اناركلى بازار) is a major bazaar in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Anarkali also serves as a neighbourhood and union council of Data Gunj Buksh Tehsil of Lahore. It is situated in the region that extends from the south of Lahori Gate of the Walled City to across the Mall Road.
The bazaar was listed in the 2020 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund to highlight the urgent need for its preservation and protection, since it is currently endangered due to neglect.

History
The Anarkali bazaar is one of the oldest surviving markets in the Indian Subcontinent, dating back at least 200 years. It derives its name from the nearby mausoleum thought to be that of a tawaif named Anārkalī, who was 'chased out of town' by order of the Mughal Emperor Akbar for having a love affair with his son, Prince Salīm, who would later become Emperor Jahāngīr.

Bazaar
Shops in Anarkali sell textiles, garments, jewellery, and many other items. The bazaar is now divided into two sections: the 'Old Anarkali Bazaar' and the 'New Anarkali Bazaar'. The Old Anarkali Bazaar is noted for its traditional food items while the New Anarakli Bazaar is known for its traditional handicraft and embroidery. Within the New Anarkali Baazaar are markets known as Bano Bazaar, Dhani Ram Road, Jan Muhammad Road, Aabkari Road, Paisa Akhbar, Urdu Bazar and Paan Gali. New Anarkali Bazar is also famous for halwa puri, nihari and siri paye.
The mausoleum of Sultan Qutb ud-Din Aibak of Mamluk Sultanate is also located in Anarkali Bazaar. In the early 1970s, the mausoleum was renovated at the orders of the then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

123,Qissa Khwani Bazaar,"The Qissa Khwani Bazaar (Pashto: قصه خوانۍ بازار, Urdu: قصہ خوانی بازار; ""Story-tellers market) is a bazaar in Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

Background
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (then North-West Frontier Province) province Gazetteer, traveller Lowell Thomas and Peshawar's British commissioner Herbert Edwardes called it ""the Piccadilly of Central Asia"".

History
On 23 April 1930, British Indian Army troops opened fire on a crowd of anti-colonial protestors at the Qissa Khwani Bazaar, killing nearly 400 people.  The colonial authorities ultimately acknowledged that the British Indian Army had killed 179 people in the massacre, which triggered protests across India and catapulted the newly formed Khudai Khidmatgar movement into prominence.
In 2010, 25 people were killed in a bomb attack at a protest against electricity shortages. The market was again targeted by militants in 2013, who used a 220 kg bomb to carry out an attack that killed over 40 people, and damaged a nearby mosque as well as set fire to several historic wooden buildings.
On 4 March 2022, 63 people were killed and 196 others wounded in a suicide attack at a mosque during Jumma prayer.
Kissa Khwani Bazaar is famous for Chai and Qehwa houses, and also because several famous Indian movie actors have origins and family ties in the region. Indian film actor Dilip Kumar was born in Qissa Khwani Bazaar on or about 11 December 1922. He belonged to Awan family. Actor Raj Kapoor and his uncle, actor Trilok Kapoor were also born in the area. Actor Shah Rukh Khan's family still lives in the area.

130,Anarkali Bazaar,"Anarkali Bazaar (Punjabi, Urdu: اناركلى بازار) is a major bazaar in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Anarkali also serves as a neighbourhood and union council of Data Gunj Buksh Tehsil of Lahore. It is situated in the region that extends from the south of Lahori Gate of the Walled City to across the Mall Road.
The bazaar was listed in the 2020 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund to highlight the urgent need for its preservation and protection, since it is currently endangered due to neglect.

History
The Anarkali bazaar is one of the oldest surviving markets in the Indian Subcontinent, dating back at least 200 years. It derives its name from the nearby mausoleum thought to be that of a tawaif named Anārkalī, who was 'chased out of town' by order of the Mughal Emperor Akbar for having a love affair with his son, Prince Salīm, who would later become Emperor Jahāngīr.

Bazaar
Shops in Anarkali sell textiles, garments, jewellery, and many other items. The bazaar is now divided into two sections: the 'Old Anarkali Bazaar' and the 'New Anarkali Bazaar'. The Old Anarkali Bazaar is noted for its traditional food items while the New Anarakli Bazaar is known for its traditional handicraft and embroidery. Within the New Anarkali Baazaar are markets known as Bano Bazaar, Dhani Ram Road, Jan Muhammad Road, Aabkari Road, Paisa Akhbar, Urdu Bazar and Paan Gali. New Anarkali Bazar is also famous for halwa puri, nihari and siri paye.
The mausoleum of Sultan Qutb ud-Din Aibak of Mamluk Sultanate is also located in Anarkali Bazaar. In the early 1970s, the mausoleum was renovated at the orders of the then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

Even though being nicknamed the ""American Market"", this market sells ""arms from the US, China, Russia, Iran and just about every other country you can think of"".
After the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021), the supply of contraband to the market has dwindled. As a result, the number of customers visiting it has significantly decreased.

150,Kennedy Market,"John F. Kennedy Market, commonly known as Kennedy Market, is a marketplace in Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan.

History
Kennedy Market was developed as a modern shopping center following a fire in Shahi Bazar in August 1961. The fire, occurring in the hometown of then Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, led to a fundraising effort for reconstruction. This initiative, led by Bhutto, raised funds from various sources including the government of Pakistan, local municipalities, [ndustrialists, traders, and the US embassy, with a notable contribution of 300,000 rupees from the latter.
Constructed on a 28,080 square feet plot on Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Road, the market was named after John F. Kennedy, reflecting the substantial aid received from the United States. It featured 38 shops and flats and was managed by a Public Charitable Trust formed by Bhutto on August 14, 1964. The trust was responsible for the market's administration and used the surplus funds for community welfare projects.
The market's management changed following Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's martial law in 1977, transferring control from the trust to the municipal authorities.
In 1988, under the primership of Benazir Bhutto, the trust briefly regained control, and efforts were made to revitalize the market, including establishing a free dispensary for women.
The market also served as a political hub, hosting offices for the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Peoples Party (Shaheed Bhutto), formed after Murtaza Bhutto's assassination. However, over the years, the market's commercial activity diminished, with many shops closing or being repurposed for storage and parking.
The decline of the market was compounded by the loss of historical documents and photographs in the events of December 27, 2007.

163,Landa bazaar,"Landa bazaar, also known as Linda bazaar, or Lunda bazaar, is a type of flea market in Pakistan, where secondhand imported goods are sold.

Sourcing
Pre-owned clothing, donated in countries such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is often distributed by charitable organizations. These organizations receive the items at no cost and sell them in bulk, priced per kilogram. Subsequently, the clothing is transported to Pakistan, where it is sorted and sent to markets.

Re-exportation
The low-cost, second-hand clothing arriving in Pakistan attracts merchants from countries like Afghanistan, India, and Turkey who purchase these items at a slightly increased price. As a result, Pakistan imports these affordable garments, selects the highest quality products in optimal condition, and exports them in an unusual instance of double-arbitrage.

When the Naulakha Pavilion was built in 1633 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a small summer house, it cost around 900,000 rupees, an exorbitant amount at the time. It is called Naulakha because in Punjabi language, the word means 'worth 9 lakhs rupees'. This also brought the word Naulakha into common use to signify something precious.

174,Shankhari Bazaar,"Shankhari Bazaar is one of the oldest areas in Old Dhaka broadly known as Shankhari Potti. It stretches along a narrow lane, lined with richly decorated brick buildings, built during the late Mughal or Colonial period.

Location
Shankhari Bazar is located near the intersection of Islampur Road and Nawabpur Road, a block north of the Buriganga River. The place especially belongs to the Bengali Hindus. About 70%–80% of the area's residents are Bengali Hindus, the rest being Muslims.

Background and Name
The area was dominated by the Shankhari community, who derived their name from Shankha, a decorated bangle crafted from slices of Shankha or conch shells. A Shankha bangle is the symbol that indicates that a Hindu woman is married. In the 17th century, the Shankharis (conch shell workers) were reportedly brought to Dhaka by the Mughal emperor, who allotted them this area for settlement; it later became known as Shankhari Bazaar.
Shankhari Bazaar is a long narrow street lined by brick buildings of some antiquity. The buildings are about 12 ft wide, 70–100 ft deep and 2–3 storeys high. The greatest height of the buildings is four storeys. Every house used to have a temple room in it.

The craft of the Shankharis
The Shankhari people are an artisan caste. Their traditional occupation is the preparation of bangles and rings made from slices of conch shell, using specialized tools. Dhaka was for long the main centre of the conch cutting industry in India. In 1971 a massacre carried out by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh War of Liberation greatly reduced the population of Shankharis in Dhaka, and the main centre of the industry is now Kolkata.

Faith
According to James Hornell F.L.S., Superintendent of the Pearl and Chank Fisheries to the Government of Madras at the beginning of the 20th century, ""The workers belong exclusively to the Sankhari sub-caste of Vaisyas: they appear to be very conservative and have the reputation of being exceedingly clannish."" Currently most of the Shankhari people belong to the Vaishnava branch of Hinduism, and some to the Shakta school; many are vegetarian.

Temples and Durga Puja
The Hindu temples are one of the major attractions of Shankhari Bazar. There are many temples on this narrow street. Over the ages, Shankhari Bazaar has been elevated to the level of the most popular centre for religious festivities.  As one of the most densely populated areas in the world Shankhari Bazaar also has the largest concentration of the Hindus in Dhaka. The temples are small in size but well decorated with ornamental motifs on the entrance and on the walls of the temples. The temples contain the statue of goddess Durga, Ganesha, Shiva etc. Durga Puja is the major festival of Hindu people. During Durga puja, people gathers in Shankhari Bazaar to worship and view goddess Durga. Besides Hindu, handful Muslims also attend the Puja. In Durga puja, Shankhari Bazaar looks quite nice because of colourful feston, banner etc. Small and temporary food shops are also built during Durga puja. People from different places come to Shankhari Bazaar to see the Puja.

Pannitola
Pannitola is in the Rakhal Chandra Basak Lane of Shankhari Bazaar. The name Pannitola basically came from the first settling area of the Panniwala, people who used to make the foil of tin. The living style of the Panniwala's was similar to the Shankhari people.

Notable residents
Nobo Kumar Bhadra, rickshaw artist, was born in Shakhari Bazar in 1964.

183,Bazaar of Pristina,"The Bazaar of Prishtina (Albanian: Çarshia e Prishtinës; Serbian: Базар у Приштини, romanized: Bazar u Prištini), Kosovo, was the core merchandising center of the Old Prishtina since the 15th century, when it was built. It played a significant role in the physical, economic, and social development of Pristina. The Old Bazaar was destroyed during the 1950s and 1960s, following the modernization slogan of ""Destroy the old, build the new"". In its place, buildings of Kosovo Assembly, Municipality of Prishtina, PTT, and Brotherhood and Unity socialist square were built. Nowadays, instead of PTT building resides the Government of Kosovo building. Only few historical buildings, such as the Bazaar Mosque and ruins of the Bazaar Hammam have remained from the Bazaar complex. Since then, Prishtina has lost part of its identity, and its cultural heritage has been scattered.

History
Bazaars (English marketplace, Turkish pazar, Serbian базар, Albanian çarshia) were unique trading complexes developed in the towns of Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans, while the area came under the Ottoman Empire. They were built during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, reaching their final shape in the 19th century. These traditional complexes were developed in two types: the Covered Bazaar or Bezistan and the Open Bazaar. While the first was a closed complex of stores, the second was characterized by consecutive rows of crafts shops, where on Tuesdays merchants exposed their products. Before their construction, people used to expose their crafts on the mosque walls, at the time being practiced only in Albanian towns.
In the 13th century, Pristina was referred to as a “village”, and in 1525 as a town, but was officially recognized only in 1775. During the 14th and 15th centuries, it became an important mining and trading center. As a Medieval trading center, the first merchants' shops emerged in the 16th century. In 1660, Evliya Çelebi claims that Pristina had a market area (Bazaar), a hammam, 11 khans and about 300 different shops. Shops were located in the Old Bazaar, which in the 18th and 19th century, was the most important economic entity. According to Ammie Boue, in 1830, the Old Bazaar was the central core of Pristina. At this time (1840), Bazaar of Pristina had around 200 crafts shops.

 
At this time, Pristina was also known for the tradesmen and craftsmen organized fairs. The first and biggest fair was in 1879, where 1200-1500 people were present. Branislav Nušić, the vice-consul of Kingdom of Serbia, after visiting Pristina in 1893–96, claimed that it had the liveliest trade. According to Nušić, in 1902 Pristina had 500 shops, 12 khans, 12 mosques, 1 Clock tower, and some warehouses. Between two World Wars, Pristina had 240 shops, mostly focused in the Old Bazaar. In the verge of Second World War, there were 365 private crafts shops, practicing about 60 different crafts. After the war, economy was industrialized, and crafts started fading.

Urban and social context of the Bazaar
Urban context
The Old Bazaar of Pristina was located in the core center of Pristina, exactly at the intersection of the two main roads, which influenced its physical, economic, and social developments. These arteries were the east–west direction or Divan-Yoll (today UÇK Street), and the north–south road (Corso, today Mother Teresa boulevard). Divan-Yoll was distinguished for the development of public domain and social life of the inhabitants, while the other road was important for the economic development. Along the north–south artery, a convoy of caravans were passing through to the other important cities of the Balkans, which influenced the development of Pristina.
On the other hand, bazaars were preferable to be located close to rivers, therefore Bazaar of Pristina was located approximately in-between Vellusha and Prishtevka rivers. Nowadays, both these rivers are covered. It was surrounded by Bedri Pejani Street in the west, UÇK Street in the north, Agim Ramadani Street in the east, and Mother Theresa Boulevard in the south. The most crowded area with shops was at the nowadays Government area.
Bazaar was not preliminary planned, but spontaneously developed along the organic network of roads. The main streets intersected at a rhombic square with a Round Fountain in the middle. These narrow roads were paved with cobblestones or macadam, and were kept very clean. In the 1950s, law for cleaning the streets was approved, according to which citizens were supposed to clean their gardens, shops, and streets, and then pile the garbage, which was later taken away by a phaeton. The Bazaar's streets were composed of parallel rows of single-story jointed shops. The residential areas were located outside the Bazaar, in a radial direction.

Architectural context
The bazaar was structured accordingly with the practiced crafts; hence each craft had its own alley. This principle was inherited from the Eastern Roman Empire. Bazaar stores were made of three main materials: adobe, wood, and stone. Masonry was made of adobe and stone. The roof structure, frontal facade, windows and eventually floor and ceiling were made of wood. From both functional and architectural viewpoints, the most important element of the stores was its frontal facade. The bazaar shops’ street facades were characterized by long eaves, large wooden windows, and multifunctional window shutters. During the day, while the shops were open, these wooden shutters were used as exposition racks. Opening and closing of the frontal shutters beside the door indicated whether the store was open or not for customers.
In general, bazaar shops were architecturally designed as single-story constructions, where the ground floor area was used for crafts-working, exposition, and trading area. Shortly, the same space was used for storing the raw material, manufacturing the artisanal products, and later exposing them for sale. Sometimes, besides the ground floor they also had an upper floor, mostly used as depot. Only during the second half of the 19th century they had two stories above. Among the shops, there were also some small cafes serving coffee, tea, and occasionally rakia.
The residential areas were located outside the Bazaar, in a radial direction, in the organic mahallas of Pristina. Houses were built on ground and first floor levels, which were constructed of strong materials and covered with tiles. Despite the influences of European architecture, their architecture remained native. These houses had great gardens, surrounded by exterior walls for family protection and privacy.

Social context
Bazaar was the most important trade and crafts center. It was famous for its annual trade fairs and goat hide and hair articles. Most notable traders were Jews, who were relatively educated and besides their own language also spoke Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, and Albanian. Bazaar of Pristina was also visited by other traders, mostly by Ragusans (from nowadays Dubrovnik), who became a vast colony. Being in such crossroads, Bazaar served as a linkage of local and other foreign craftsmen.
Craftsmanship and commerce networks were organized in guilds. Guilds were an Ottoman model of the corporate economy organizations. They protected economic, social, political, military, religious, educational and other craftsmen interests. These guilds had a common voluntary fund, which was used to financially support poor and ill craftsmen, to educate young artisans, to establish schools and build some public buildings. On the other hand, they controlled the economic life, especially the tanners and bakers guilds, which controlled the prices.
Besides trading, Bazaar of Pristina was also the main place for public encounters. Its shops were also used for blood feud reconciling, selling and purchasing of property, affiancing procedures, setting of marriage dates, developing patriotic feelings, and cultivating trust or Besa. Closeness of shops made people get closer with each other. There was a lot of respect among them. People used to hang around and drink tea with each other in front of their shops. Whenever a new shop opened, people used to throw coins on the ground, believing that this superstitious act would bring fortune. Other signs of good luck were horseshoes, and garlic head or horn.

Important building landmarks
Bazaar Mosque
Bazaar or Çarshi Mosque was initially started in 1389 as a mark of Ottoman forces victory in Kosovo Was, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century, by Sultan Bayazid. It was the first mosque built in Kosovo. By that time, it used to overlook over the covered part of Bazaar. Since then, Bazaar Mosque has gone through significant changes, being initially repaired in 1820 and 1902 by Sulltan Abdylhamid II. As a result, its original look has been modified, but the stone-topped minaret, its distinguishing symbol, has been preserved for more than a half millennium, respectively 600 years. Carshı Mosque is also known as ‘Tas Mosque’, which literally means ‘Stone Mosque’. Bazaar It is one of 21 protected buildings in Pristina, listed since 1967.

Bazaar Hammam
Bazaar or Old Hammam is assumed to have been built in the 15th century, approximately at the same time as the Great Hammam of Pristina. As a public bath for cleaning and recreation, it was an important part of Bazaar. The Old Hammam was located just in front of the Bazaar Mosque. Following the destruction of the Baazar, Hammam was ruined too. Its stone foundations were found during the construction of today's Kosovo Assembly building, in 1959. Besides of their listing for state protection, they were covered and no further researches of the Hammam building and site have been made.

Khan
Khans or inns were specific buildings located in Pristina’s Bazaar that offered accommodation for traders and their animals, serving as a facilitation of trade. Khan consisted of two floors. Ground floor was a shelter for animals, whereas the upper one was a shelter for people. There were served coffee, tea, and food. In 1870-1880 Pristina possessed around 10 Khans. Before Second World War there were 3 khans located in Korzo Street in the Old Bazaar.

Bezistan
In 1830, Pristina had a Covered Bazaar known as Bezistan. Among the inhabitants it was also known as ""Kapalı Çarshı"", according to the Turkish language. This structure was a distinguished road with parallel consecutive shops, surrounded by walls and closed with huge arched doors at both sides of the road. It was covered with bricks for around 15–20 meters at its entrance. The high security enabled safety provisions while trading valuable goods. The covered complex had nearly 150-200 crafts shops. Interior of the Bezistan was attractive and interesting, thus resembling the bazaars of many oriental kasabas. 
Covered Bazaar is supposed to have been located in the southern part of the Open Old Bazaar, in-between Carshı Mosque in the east and Korzo Street in the west; nowadays, approximately near the building of Assembly of Kosovo. In its western exit, between the crafts shops, complex was The Round Sadirvanc(“Shadërvani Rrethor”) with one fountain-head and concrete tub. Water from the fountain on the lower part of Bazaar, was used for maintaining the shops and other needs of inhabitants.

Synagogue
Synagogue, named ""Havra-Sinagoga"", was located in the southwestern part of the Bazaar, near the end of the Bezistan. It was used by Jews for their Saturday rituals. These Jews living in Pristina, were owners of many shops and their houses were lined along the Divan-Yol Street.

Bazaar Tekke
Bazaar Tekke was located near the western exit of the Covered Bazaar. It has also been destroyed.

Shops and crafts
Shops were decorated and filled with goods. There were shops of moccasin shoes, saddlers, curriers, Albanian fez makers, etc. Among which were from tanning to leather dyeing, belt making and silk weaving, and also military crafts as armorers, smiths, and saddle makers. In 1485 the artisans started producing gunpowder. There were also many cafés and tea shops, sweet-shops, and bakers. There were also other shops were oriental foods were served, kebab stores, butchers, pharmacies, libraries, barbers, watchmakers.
There were around 50 different handicrafts practiced in the Bazaar of Pristina. They were crafted by gifted silversmiths, goldsmiths, coppersmiths, tinsmiths, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, tub-makers, cutlers, potters, farriers, saddlers, boot makers, tailors, quilters, and curries. Especially Pristina was known as the center of coppersmiths and pottery crafting, which spread later in other Kosovo cities, such as Prizren, Gjakova, Peja, Gjilan. Copper pots were crafted for domestic and cult purposes. These pots were crafted from copper and brass by forging, smelting and savat techniques. On the other hand, clay pots were crafted for wheat and water preservation (water vessels and jugs). Decorations used in these crafts were wavy zigzag lines, circles, and semicircles.
Saddling was also developed in Pristina, besides Gjakova, Prizren, Gjilan, and Peja. Among the crafts were: horse and oxen gears, such as bridles, halters, tacks, collars, headgear, pads, saddles, stirrups, and cuirasses. These supplies were decorated with beads, charms, tufts, and mirrors.
Pristina was also identified with tailoring and silk processing. Tailors used to make national costumes mostly for wealthy class men and women. Among these items were waistcoats, coats, and robes.
Craftsmen of Pristina manufactured slippers as well. Slippers were made of soft leather (sahtian) fabric, embroidered with golden colored strings on the top. There were also shoe-crafts as leather shoes or moccasins, and clogs adorned with silver or pearly incrustation.
Crafts considered as touristic attractions containing folkloric elements, were supported with suitable shops and lower taxes. Also new crafts emerged as: radio-technicians, electro-technicians, hydro-installers, auto-mechanics, etc. Nowadays, most of handicrafts do not exist or have been transformed into new trades. Some of them are the handicraft of curriers, saddlers, tailors, silk processors, goat wool rug makers, and embroiders potters. On the other hand, even though in a small number, the old craft shops that still exist are blacksmiths and cutlers.

Destruction of the Bazaar
Early destruction
Bazaar and some other parts of Pristina were destroyed by two great fires in 1859 and 1863, just while Pristina was having its peak development.
In 1912, following the Serbian invasions, many feudal and intellectual Albanian and Turkish families were deported to Turkey. Among them were the main town's craftsmen. As a result, the shops were abandoned and Bazaar significance started fading.

Destroy the old, and build the new
The peak of communist politics was during the 1950s when the urban development was established under the motto “Destroy the old, build the new’. Pristina had eastern features till the end of the Second World War. After this period destruction of these characteristics and old parts of the city took place. 
The Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center (including mosques, churches, houses) were destroyed.
A significant part of old Pristina was destroyed to be replaced later with newer architecture. Old buildings were substituted with new ones, and streets were widened and paved with cobblestones. Few remaining old buildings, belonging to Ottoman period, were left without institutional care.
""Until the end of World War II, Pristina has been a typical oriental city. After liberation, Pristina experienced rapid development, becoming a modern city. Shops and unstable old structures started disappearing, making space for building high buildings of modern style”.
The so-called “Unstable old structures”, which covered one of the largest bazaars in the region were demolished after the war. This spiritual center of the city has lost its mosque, a catholic church and synagogues. Since the 1945, the story of Pristina is a gray, tragic story of its destruction and many misfortunes. During the communist era, the annihilation of the past was the outcome of non liberal politics. 
In the aftermath of World War Two, Yugoslavia was governed by communist authorities who implemented various modernisation drives toward changing the architectural landscape and design of urban settlements. These measures were aimed at altering the panorama of a settlement that was deemed to have elements associated with an unwanted Ottoman past and features deemed as ""backward"". Starting from the late 1940s, architectural heritage in main urban centres of Kosovo began to be destroyed, mainly conducted by the local government as part of urban modernisation schemes. During the 1950s this process was undertaken by the Urban Planning Institute (Urbanistički zavod) of Yugoslavia with the most prominent example in Kosovo of the socialist modernisation drive being in Pristina. The Ottoman Prishtina bazaar contained 200 shops set in blocks devoted to a craft or guild owned by Albanians grouped around a mosque, located in the centre of Prishtinë. These buildings were expropriated in 1947 and demolished by labour brigades known as Popular Fronts (Albanian: Fronti populluer, Serbian: Narodnifront).
After the Second World War in 1953, Pristina had its first urban plan, made by Serbian architect Partonic, approved. Citizens, eager for modern city, volunteered in the new city order. This was the starting point of the Bazaar destruction where many crafts shops were ruined to make space for the new Municipality Assembly and Parliament of Kosovo. Everything ‘old’ and of Albanian and Turkish roots was destroyed;  only a few remained. At that time, some Russian architects insisted on preserving the Bazaar's architecture. Nevertheless, the system decided to destroy everything.
In 1954, a master plan was approved by Institute for the Protection and Study of Cultural Monuments. The main element of it was the placement of a complex of new municipal and provincial government buildings at its center, where the Ottoman-era bazaar of Pristina was located. In the second half of the 1950s, some of the new buildings intended in Pristina's master plan were constructed such as: a provincial assemblage building, a city hall, and a new main street with modernist mixed-use buildings. All these buildings were located on the site of Pristina's destroyed bazaar or next to other condemned Ottoman-era architecture. The destruction of Ottoman-era architecture signified the beginning of modernization.
The most radical transformations in Bazaar of Pristina happened from 1960 to 1970. At this time, its small shops, streets, religious and other public buildings were destroyed for the sake of the new. Thus Pristina lost an important feature of its historic and cultural heritage. On the other hand, the shops’ destruction affected the craftsmen's lives. Some of them never recovered their businesses or migrated abroad.
Pristina was turned into an administrative town, from town of gardens and artisans. In the Bazaar area, new administrative buildings were built. In 1965, there was a public debate held among local experts of architecture and other relevant fields, city officials and citizens, who criticized this Urban Plan, which the architect could not justify. Since then, local experts made corrections and undertook further urban developments of Pristina. In 1966, few roads were paved and new high-rise socialist apartment blocks were built.

184,List of bazaars in Kosovo,"A bazaar or souk, is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold.
The term bazaar originates from the Persian word bāzār. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the ""network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen"" who work in that area. Although the word ""bazaar"" is of Persian origin, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world.
The term souk (Arabic: سوق suq, Hebrew: שוק shuq, Syriac: ܫܘܩܐ shuqa, Armenian: շուկա shuka, Spanish: zoco, also spelled souq, shuk, shooq, soq, esouk, succ, suk, sooq, suq, soek) is used in Western Asian, North African and some Horn African cities (Amharic: ሱቅ sooq).

185,Old Bazaar (Gjakova),"The Old Bazaar (Albanian: Pazari i vjetër; Serbian: Стари базар / Stari bazar) in Gjakova is the oldest bazaar in Kosovo (also known as Çarshia e Madhe (Grand Bazaar) or Dakovica. Mëhalla e Hadumit, the historical neighborhood where it is located also houses the city's oldest mosque, the Hadum Mosque (Xhamia e Hadumit), which dates from the 15th century.
The Grand Bazaar (from the Turkish: Çarşı meaning marketplace Albanian: Çarshia e Vjetër) was the heart of the economy in Gjakova, a city of trade and merchandise which served the villages around the municipality of Gjakova, the Junik zone and Gjakova’s highlands (Malësia e Gjakovës) on the border between Kosovo and Albania. The Old Bazaar was burnt and destroyed and then it was reconstructed after suffering damage during the 1999 war (the last war in Kosovo).
Around the mosque lie the graves with sculpted decorations, with inscriptions engraved in the old Ottoman language. In the past, it was used to bury members of the popular families in Gjakova. Within the mosque’s complex were the hamam (Turkish bath) which was destroyed in 2008, the building of the old library, from 1671 (burnt by Serbian forces during the war of 1999 and totally ruined in 2000) and also meytepi from 1777.
The bazaar is linked to the city centre, just five minutes away via the IslamBegu Bridge. The bazaar covers an area of about  35,000 m2 (380,000 sq ft) and the length of its main road is 1 km, with about 500 shops situated along it. It is, however, still home to an active mosque, several türbes, and a clock tower, which was destroyed during the First Balkan War and was recently rebuilt.

History
Grand Bazaar of Gjakova arose with the appearance of the first craftsmen and the artisan processing produce; it arose then when Gjakova obtained the kasaba (small town) status, when in 1003 H (1594/95), Selman Hadim Aga donated some public facilities, which he had built himself to religious institutions the Hadum Mosque, a meytep (elementary religious school), a library, a muvakit-hane, “a building for measuring the time and determining the calendar by means of astrolabic quadrates"", a public bath (hamam), an inn and some shops. For the maintenance of these facilities he asked from sultan to attach to his “vakif” some lands of sultan properties (hases), whose income should be used for the maintenance of the mentioned buildings and for the payment of the staff that would work there.
However, the first direct facts about the Grand Bazaar were provided by the Turk traveloguer Evlia Çelebi, who visited Gjakova in 1662 and, it seems, was amazed by the beauty and treasure of the city and of Gjakovar citizens. Among other things, he wrote: “Jakova has two thousand decorated houses located in a vast field. It has two beautiful mosques, mosques without a minaret (“mesjide”), inns covered in lead. It has a beautiful public bath (hamam) that pleases your heart and about three hundred shops with one thousand kinds of crafts. Referring to the impressions the Gjakovars left on him, he continues ""Since it has a lovely climate, the inhabitants are good looking and kind"".
As it can be seen from the beginnings, there was a great number of shops in the Grand Bazaar, in which almost all kinds of trades were developed aiming at fulfilling all the needs of the population of the region of Gjakova and of export such as those of metal processors, leather processors, textile processors, tinsmiths, saddlers, (shag-makers) white woolen cap-makers, rug-makers etc.
The metal processing included some very important trades for that time, such as gunsmiths, silversmith, copper dishes productions, tinsmith etc. In the 18th century the famous gun master Tush the gunsmith was mentioned in Gjakova, who dealt not only with their producing, but also with their decoration. As a master of luxurious guns producing, which at that time were requested without any distinction by all the social classes, he managed to create, in this century, “the people's school"" of this trade, known until today by his name.

Hadum Mosque
A shepherd from the Guskë village was looking after his sheep and goats. The Turkish (Ottoman) guards noticed that a bird was flying over him, which according to the saint books, meant that he was a good and wise man, so they went and talked to him. He invited them as guests for a night and hosted them with all he had. The shepherd also was a good talker and the Turkish guards learned that his name was Hadum and understood that he was very smart and wanted to be educated. Hadum was taken to Istanbul, where he finished the preacher school. After that, he wanted his own mosque so the Turkish administration helped him again. The Turkish guards searched for an appropriate place for a mosque, not far from the Guskë village. They noticed a flat field, close to a hill (now known as the Çabrati hill), and found the owners of the land, with whom they talked about buying a piece of land. The owners were Jak and his brother Vulë, and they didn’t want to sell any land. The Turkish guards managed to change their minds and they told them they only needed land as much as the skin of an ox, and the brothers agreed. In fact, they were really crafty. They took the skin of an ox, cut all of its big, long hair and they put it in a sack. The other day they went to the field, took the hair out and started to put them on the ground. The brothers saw that the Turkish guards had lied to them, but since they had nothing to say, they only wanted the place’s name to be Jakovë (the combination of the brothers’ names Jakë and Vulë). The Turkish administration accepted the name, which later was changed to Gjakovë. 
70 years later, Evliya Çelebi said that around the plain of Jak Vula and Hadum Mosque were 2000 houses, some masjid and two monumental mosques, inns covered in lead, a beautiful hamam and 300 shops. The Hadum Mosque as an architectural building belongs to the classic forms of the mosques in the group of the Kosovar style. It is covered with cubes; it has a right-angled rectangular base and a minaret which comes out of the south-west wall, in a right-angled base. The blueprint and the compositional scheme contain these parts: the hall of praying, Hayat and the minaret.

Crafts
The craft of cutlers, that used to be practised also in Gjakova, was older than the one of gunsmiths. The craftsmen dealing with this craft used to produce different knives, such as ""dimi"", daggers, yatagans, etc., whose handles they decorated with beautiful ornaments.
According to the English author Night, Gjakova was one of the most interesting towns with quite craftily inhabitants in metal processing. He would express himself that “the most beautiful saddles, filigree products, the golden sword handles making and the decorations of yatagans and pistols were produced here from hard-working people. He would, further continue: “Albanians of Shkodra, Gjakova and Prizren are well-known masters in the production of guns and other items of metal. J. Mueller claimed in 1838, about Gjakova, that the guns of this town especially the pistols enjoy a special respect also in Sarajevo.
Luxury personal objects and other artistic items, worked in gold, silver and pearls were constructed here. The silversmiths' works matched not only the taste and requirements of the local population, but also those of foreign countries. Therefore, the silversmiths became well-known with their artistic products everywhere. Th. Ippen wrote that the silver products of Gjakova were traded everywhere and “are famous all over Albania”. The English journalist Mehew wrote, among other things: “Albanians are not only hardworking and capable of different handwork, but the country has some rare products, which do not remain behind some artistic products of our western capitals at all. Can this be said for Montenegrins, Bosnians or Serbs? In the towns of Peja and Gjakova filigree works in gold and silver are made, which are much better than those of Malta, both from the artistic sense expressed in their motives and in the weaving and wonderful finesse of these items. These excellent works of Gjakova, similar to laces, are demanded in every market, as well as very precious “golden cups made in filigree, made to protect the hand from burning”- as Lord Byron mentioned them in his work Don Juan, which usually are put under the little coffee cups, are always of Albanian production.
Among Gjakovar silversmiths' products for personal decoration were the rings, earrings, wrist rings, “feses”, etc. that were used in local rich families and were exported to Istanbul. Also, the silversmiths used to decorate the pipes, mirror frames, etc.

Guns
According to the 19th-century Bulgarian scholar, Ivan Mihov, Gjakova was also among most important centers of luxurious guns production. The Shkodra French consul, Hecardy, would write that “same as all the other Albanians, also the highlanders like luxurious guns"", which were decorated with a lot of art (passion), with carving, with mother-of pearls (“sedef”) and pearls, which were produced in Prizren, Gjakova and in Tetova. Gunsmiths of Gjakova, had become well known for the production of ""Gjakova pistols”, “whose value consisted especially in the beauty of the round but pommel or rosary"".
As better known Gjakovar gunsmiths are mentioned Tusha from the 18th century, whose name is related to the development of gunsmithery and silversmithery in this town, whereas in the 19th century Emin Kazari, Murat Nuka, Ramadan Nuka, Çaush Basha, Beqir Pula, etc. are mentioned. Referring to the gunsmithery tradition, Theodor Ippen, among other things, wrote, “…Earlier, in Shkodra, Prizren, and in Gjakova, there were large gunsmith, long rifle, and side-handgun and yataghan workshops. These old guns were then in wide use. There are facts, according to which Gjakovar gunsmiths set up workshops also outside their place, competing successfully the products of those places where they established their shops. Thus they caused the discontent of the local gunsmiths. In a letter sent to prince Milos, on 6 October 1837, it is said that in Gurgusovac there is a gunsmith from Gjakova, Bajram Mustafa with his two sons-apprentices, against whom the local craftsmen were complaining.
Tushe was considered as the most talented master for producing and decoration of celinas. The long rifles and those of waist of Gjakova, produced ""in the Albanian fashion"", decorated with gold and silver had become well-known all over Europe since the 18th century. However, according to Franz Noptsche, Gjakova became well-known later also for the producing of ""martin"" type guns and was a strong competitor in selling this product in the home market. But this gun model as well as other guns of Albanian fashion were sold also abroad in most distant markets. Gjakovar gunsmiths used to produce also other necessary equipment for the use of guns, such as circles, which were in use until the 1860s and 1870s, until the beginning of use of fire guns with “viaskas”. Although initially the Gjakovar gunsmiths produced rifles, later they shifted exclusively to bullet producing. Among other things, they would go to cattle fairs in Ivanjica, where they would successfully sell their products. The Gjakova craftsmen used to produce cartridges for the rebels of Karageorge. According to Sami Frashëri in Gjakova guns, silver, Albanian national costumes and some kinds of silk fabrics were produced. The trade was very much developed there. Often Albanian guns were called (labelled) by the names of places of production. Thus, among other things, the Gjakovars (the hunt guns) were well known, guns that were decorated according to the “people’s school” style of the 18th century of the famous gunsmith and silversmith Tusha.

Clothing
The working of national costumes, which were decorated with autochthonous ornaments, had the priority for both women and men. It is known that the Albanian national costumes were distinguished for their beauty and for the fine taste of Albanian tailors. Therefore, it is no wonder why Byron had bought Albanian costumes, in which he was painted in front of European artists. The Russian academic Alexander Hilferding, who visited Gjakova in 1857, wrote among other things: ""The mydyrr of Gjakova, an Albanian of extraordinary beauty, dressed in a wide faultless white kilt and with a short red jacket stitched (embroidered) in gold, sent me to the clergyman's house.... The tailors of Gjakova worked costumes according to the taste and requests of different social categories and according to the needs of different countries, where they sold their products. They embroidered with modest equipment with gold or silver fibers and, from time to time, in lace (galloons) gowns, waistcoats, tight woolen trousers, sleeveless dresses (fermens), vests (doublets-for women), dolmans, shirts (mintans), etc.

Weavers
The weavers of Gjakova produced out of silk and wool fibers of all kinds for the decoration of different parts of national wear galloons, strips, buttons, silk thread (ibrisimi) etc. for the town and their weavers. They would sell these products successfully also in other towns. According to original (local) legends, in 1864, they sent to the international fair of Prilep, 20 bales (bundles) with items of an amount of 120 thousand groshes.
Gjakova was well known for its talented white woollen cap producers, since the establishment of the Grand Bazaar, because the white cap was part of Albanian national costume. It is known that the type of the white round cap (kësulë) similar to present day cap (plis) represents a part of Illyrian wear. The Albanians who took part in the battle of Kosovo, in 1389, according to the legend, came with white woollen caps, as the present day ones. In addition to this, the type of white woollen cap called the Scanderbeg grave speaks of the antiquity of the Albanian woollen white cap. 
Thanks to ethnic structure of the population of Gjakova, which the Russian academic Hilferding, called, in 1857, the Albanian city Gjakova was from the beginning the only town of this craft, whereof it spread also into other regions of Kosovo, Northern Albania, Western Macedonia, Sanjak of Jeni Pazar, etc., whilst another town for the South and Middle Albania was Tirana. The mentioned places were supplied in the 18th and 19th centuries with white woollen caps from Gjakova.
White woollen cap makers from Gjakova set up their workshops also in Shkup, in Tetova, in Pazar i Ri, in Sjenica and in Sarajevo. 
The oldest way of making the white woollen caps with a log (block) (taslak), that was used until the end of the 19th century, was called the ""Gjakovar” way (fashion), which differed way from the most perfect way of ""Tirana"" with two logs (blocks) (taslaks), which started being practised also in Gjakova around the end of 19th century and beginning of the century. The foreman of white woolen cap makers’ guild in Gjakova, which was not as strong as the others in the time of Turkey, was mentioned to have been Jup Bakalli. The Craftsmen Chamber of Gjakova had registered 16 white woollen cap shops before the World War II.

Tailors
Since the 18th century, especially in the 20th century, along with the metal processing, the processing of wool and silk, etc., went also on. In the Grand Bazaar of Gjakova felt cloth, woollen and silk fabrics (cloths), woollen and silk pipings (galloons) etc. used to be produced and sold in great amounts and were exported in even greater amounts in the markets and fairs of the neighboring provinces of Balkan countries, in Medieval countries and in Central European countries, too. Beautiful and high quality carpets and rugs were produced and sold there. The year book (""Salname"") of Prizren Vilayet of 1874 used to mention the great number of tailors (“terzis”), tanners (“tabaks”) and embroiderers. The tailors used to work, according to it, first class cord dolmans and waistcoats for women and men, but these products used to meet only the country's needs. But for their own needs, the inhabitants of kasaba (the town) used to produce a kind of rough woollen cloth-worsted cloth. This shows that the textile artisan production had exceeded the patriarchal borders and had entered widely into the road of production of goods for market. 
In Gjakova the tailors were divided into categories according to the town social classes. The first category for example, worked for the rich city classes with selected import cloths which were with high prices. Sami Frasheri claimed that the Gjakova craftsmen “sew nice costumes weave the galloon, produce ""sole"", shoes and other products”. In Peje and Gjakova, he would continue, “guns, silver dishes, national Albanian costumes and some silk fabrics were produced”. This craft (trade) existed in Gjakova until the 1970s. This craft is nowadays practised only by women “which is a unique and characteristic phenomenon for this craft and typically for Gjakova”. However, until recently it was practised also by men in their houses, like Him Xhama, Reshyt Xharra etc. In fact even today this craft is practiced by Mr. Fehmi Shllaku. The tailors' guild in Gjakova was the most powerful guild.
According to Ivan Stepanovich Jastrebov, the tailors' guild was distinguished for its wealth. It had 200 shops, which were always busy. Let us mention that the Gjakova craftsmen of national costumes for brides and other young women, with luxurious decorations with gold and silver fibers (filaments), practised this craft until recently only in Gjakova, whereof it spread also in other regions of Kosovo, because these wears got again in trend. The waistcoats and shirts (mintans) became an obligatory part of costumes for brides and young women. In the period 1945- 1963 Gjakova had twice more tailors than any other center of Kosova. Pristina had 39 tailor and tailor shops, Mitrovica had 61, Prizren 60, Peja 56, whilst Gjakova 112, of which 69 were registered as old tailors (terzis), whereas 47 as modern tailors.

Leather production
The leather production gave impetus also to the development of the craft of furrier (leather worker), craft of leather processing. The furriers produced boxes for tobacco and money, saddlebags, cartridge belts, wallets, sashes (leather waistbands), saddles, reins, bridles, belts and other necessary products for the supply of transport and pack animals. Saddles were the most precious articles produced by the furriers. They were decorated with silver, with colorful and metal decorations etc. In Shkodra, in Gjakova, and in Manastir, according to Mueller, saddles were produced, which differed from the others, because their rear and front parts were more lifted. The furriers (leather workers), same as tanners and slipper makers, used to sell their products inland and abroad. But around the end of the 19th century the fall of these crafts started.
The making of moccasins was a craft related to the leather production and spread in the Grand Bazaar since early times. However, the production of shoes influenced in the fall of this production in the 1890s. According to the yearbook (salname) of Kosovo vilayet of 1887 “low-heel shoes and slipper of Gjakova have fallen and they do not have the previous value”.
An old craft practised until recently was the one of fur processing with domestic and wild animal leather, such as those of suckling lambs, of foxes, of beech marten etc. The furs that were produced in Gjakova, which had a good tradition in this production, were also sold in outer market. Mueller wrote “the processing of wild leather into furs and of sheep leather is done in Peja, Gjakova and Dibra. In Gjakova the craft of goat-wool rug makers was developed, which was related to the way of goods transportation on horses, in caravans.  The raw material of these craftsmen was the goat wool for producing rags, rugs, sacks, saddle-bags, different bags, breast collars and horse covers, large sacks, different rugs (halis) for bedding etc. In the early 20th century the rug makers of Gjakova processed 2 thousand kg of goat wool.

Pipe makers
It is worth mentioning that Gjakova was known in the whole region of Dukagjini Plain mostly for the development of pipe-makers craft, whilst the center for Kosovo was Pristina. This craft existed in these two centers until the late 1960s. Other craftsmen like clog (wooden sandal) makers, carpenters, and wood carvers from villages etc. used to deal with production of pipes, long pipes (chibouks, çubuks), and cigarette-boxes. In the past this craft was carried out also by silversmiths, who took care particularly of decoration of long pipes and weavers, who wove with silky galloons parts of the smoking set. The raw material used for the production of chibouks, long pipes, cigarette boxes and pipes was wood and horn, but in the past, ivory and bones were used. The terminology of this craft in Gjakova was in Albanian, whereas in Pristina it was in Turkish language.
The oldest chibouk-makers family was the one of Zejnullah Ramadani, who until around 1958 kept his shop in the Little Bazaar. Until then also the brothers Dan and Shaban Dema and Ahmet Muhaxhiri had their shops in the end of 19th century, due to better profit conditions. Beqir Tirana moved in (settled) in Gjakova, who returned to his hometown in the early 20th century.

Carpentry
The carpenters, who had their shops, many in the Box-makers Street, but also in other parts of the Grand Bazaar and other parts of the city, worked and carved with hand tools objects for daily needs in household, in building and in artisan workings, such as boxes and housewife boxes for brides, cradles and hammocks for children, boards for braziers and brassieres; school desks, folding chairs for reading, bookcases, shelves and ceiling decorations, decorations and carvings for rifle butts, coffins and equipment for Muslim and Christian corpses etc. They decorated luxurious products with paints and carving. They learned the painting craft, the combination of eleven paints, from the master Rexhep Shkodra. Inspired from him, they became later themselves authors of different ornaments of floral world with the wood carving that they had inherited from ancient times. 
The most famous carpenters were the families of Qarri, Kusari, Canamusa, Alushi and Cana of Dallt, Rasim and Ymer Tullumi, Tafil Morinaa, Ismet Saliuka etc.

Bookbinding
Another interesting characteristic, it seems, only for Gjakova, was the bookbinders' craft (mucelits), who, dealt with the binding of different books and manuscripts; repairing old books damaged by long usage or of any other physical damage and, above all they dealt with copying the works of different authors, which, they then distributed to libraries, or gave as gifts to their friends or to well-known scholars. They were usually people who cultivated nice handwriting. Their work tools were usual, simple of wood, which were made, in our concrete case, by the bookbinders themselves. This craft was practiced traditionally in Gjakova, from generation to generation by the members of Doli family until recently. In the second half of the 19th century Bajram Jusuf Doli (1833–1917), a non-exhausting handwriting copier was mentioned, who, in addition to the craft of the bookbinder, also practiced the profession of a teacher. Almost all the writing in Albanian with the Arabic alphabet such as those of Mullah Beqir, of Mullah Dervish, etc., were copied with his hand. He constructed the tools for binding the manuscripts and books made of wood. There is not a town in Kosovo in which one cannot find of his manuscripts. We can say one that over one hundred manuscripts that are kept in different collections in Kosovo have been copied and bound by this great sympathizer of the written word. About Mullah Bajram Efendi Doli, as well-known copier of old oriental literature and other manuscripts written in Arabic Ottoman alphabet we have data from different authors and old citizens Mullah Bajram copied rare and unique specimens with an artistic handwriting, bound, sow and made the covers.
One of four works in manuscript, unknown until now, of Tahir Efendi Boshnjaku-Gjakova, found and identified recently, Hyda Rabbem (God is my Lord), written in lyrics, in Ottoman language in 1832, is kept only in three copies, two of which were copied by Bajram Jusuf Doli, whereas one by Muhamed Tahir Jaka, also from Gjakova. The son of Mullah Bajram, Mullah Hamdi Efendi Doli (1897–1994) was the last bookbinder from this family, who practiced this craft at home. He spent all his life on books, cleaned them page per page, folded them up and bound them with a special passion. The tools, he worked with were old and very interesting."" He copied the books so nice that it was difficult to distinguish them from those of the printing house. He put them within the cover bound them with a needle and rope or with glue, according to the demands of the requester. He also arranged the archives of administrative documents, which he bound in the form of a book and was well paid for that, but he distributed this profit to the poor. The existence of this craft itself speaks of the high cultural-educational level of this prospering artisan and trade center (town).

Musical instruments
Another craft, about which there are very few data available, is that of musical instruments production. We know only that in Gjakova used to live in the second half of the 19th century the well-known singer and musician Ramadan Gunga, who supported his family by his craft of a master of musical instruments production, such as sharkhis, two-stringed lutes, etc., that his beautiful sharkhis were decorated with a mother-of-pear eagle and with ivory spots, that he had a shop and that on the market day he played nice melodies to advertise his ware. We also know that his pupil and later his friend, the singer and instrumentalist, Din Bakija, had made himself a sharkhi and a personal box. This craft was practiced, along with their basic vocation, also by the carpenters and wood-carvers, who mostly dealt with mending the broken instruments, such as the well-known master in Gjakova, Rasim Tullumi. He had acquired his basic knowledge on the features of different kinds of wood that he used in different parts of a musical instrument, from his father Malush. In the production and repair of musical instruments Rasim was aided by his brother Ymer, who, as an instrumentalist of bugan (sort of a musical instrument), his father Malush, had brought him from Istanbul, participated in the musical group of Ymer Riza.

Trade
According to some statistics in the early 20th century in Gjakova there were 400 craftsmen. The vigorous development of craftsmanship stimulated also the development of trade. ""The people of Gjakova have a tendency agriculture, but they are more betrothed to trade. They go to distant places where they open their shops, inns etc. to provide for their living"" was written in the yearbook (salname) of the vilayet of Kosova in 1887. The Gjakovar traders and craftsmen used to sell their product not only in Grand Bazaar, but also in many markets in other towns of Ottoman Empire, of Serbia and Austria. According to the facts, in the 1720s, the traders of Pristina and Gjakova transported their goods firstly to Dubrovnik and then to Italy. In 1803 the trader (merchant) from Gjakova, Jonuz Spahiu, had sold 114 bales of small leathers in Venice. In 1827 Salih Gjakova and Kërsto Gjakova sent gunpowder, rifles and flint stone to Sarajevo, whilst a year later, Hasan Gjakova and his nephew Hamza sent three bales of rifles to Serbia. According to the minutes of customs duty (cymryks) of Pozhega, of Aleksinac, of Kragujevac, of Mokra Gora, of Belgrade, etc., the traders from Gjakova sold their goods such as silk galloons, tobacco, rice, maize, eels, razors, soles, double-barrel sporting rifles, pistols, long rifles, cartridges, gunpowder, flint stones, wax, snuff, different leathers, salt, oil, cotton, cotton breast collars, cotton ribbons, silver galloons, scarfs, figs etc. Ali Sulejmani from Gjakova, in 1837, transported 56 loads of sheep leathers and other goods in an amount of 283.38 groshes, through Belgrade to Austria whereas in 1841, Halil Dobruna transported through Serbia to Austria galloons in an amount of 1800 groshes and 21,5 loads of Morocco leather (saftjan). 
In Serbian folk songs Gjakova is mentioned as ""the Albanian market"" (Arnaut Pazar in Turkish). According to Mueller: “Sheep are developed, especially around Gjakova, and their wool makes a considerable item of export. Among better known traders, the rich family of Hajdar’s is mentioned, which dealt with wool foreign trade. They had their branches in Vidin, in Budapest, in Vienna, in Thessaloniki, in Istanbul etc. In addition to this, they had large properties in the district of Nish, Leskocvac and Vranje which they kept until 1878.

Hostels
The dense development of foreign trade suggested the need for hotel-keeping facilities, where the traders and pack animals, as the only means of goods transport, would rest. Almost all the houses of the citizens of Gjakova had alongside the large front door at the end of the large yard, a dwelling/housing facility, which consisted a room for known and unknown guests, with a fireplace, a bathroom and a separate toilet; a livery stable for placing the pack animals and the hayloft above it for keeping the animal food (nutrition), then the wheat wooden case (granary), maize case etc. In this part of the house the guests, who didn't manage to complete all the works during the market day, were placed and fed, which in some cases, when the Grand Bazaar reached its peak of development, lasted until three days sometimes it was organized even twice a week. The houses of beys, agas and of middle classes were in the form of towers with two or three floors, in a more beautiful style than those of the village, like fortresses with large yards, at the end of which was the guests' quarter (selamllek). Such was the yard of the house of Avdi beg in the center of town next to Hadum Mosque. 
On the other hand, there were other public hotel-keeping facilities- the inns and caravanserais. Inns were similar in function to the present-day hotels, whilst caravanserais, as the word itself suggests, served for placing the passengers and their pack animals that participated in the caravan for carrying the goods. In 1835, the Haraqia Inn was known in Gjakova. During the 1870s and 1880s Gjakova had 16 inns. Mueller mentions in 1838 the large caravansary of Gjakova that hosted up to 100 guests traders with their animals and where the Armenian money ex-changers (sarafs) had their large halls as well. A hotel was also mentioned in Gjakova, which was state owned property to hotel-keepers with high fees, who often reached up to 300 thousand piastres a year. According to an old Byzantine tradition, which was developed even more in the period of Ottoman rule, each craft or trade had its street or road (square). This style of arrangement was organized by guilds, which had imposed a strict discipline and a rigorous control in production, both regarding the quality and quantity of the goods that were allowed to be produced and especially to brindle the competition between the craftsmen and the trader members of the guild.

Shejh Emin Tekke
The Shejh Emin Tekke is situated at the complex of the Gjakova Big Bazaar, at the part called the ""main market"". It was built in the XVII ct.  The building belongs to Saadi sect, and the constructor was Shejh Emin. His profession was also professional layer (called ""kadi"") educated at the Ottoman Empire centres. The inheritor of the tekke is now Shejh Ruzhdi. A characteristic of the tekke is that during its building it was applied the traditional building method. The foundation and the ground floor were built by the carved stone, while the first floor was built by bricks, the roof is a wooden construction with extended eaves and there are decorations on the walls and on the ceiling. On its floor it is situated the zone of ""samahane"" which is the praying quarter while the cupola is wood carved. Architecture concept of the object belongs to the citizen folk architecture and presents a complex of buildings with tekkes, tyrbes (small mausoleums), samahane (ritual prayer hall), fountains, houses and other following buildings. Interior and exterior are rich in carved woodwork. This building is explicit for its guestroom on the second floor shaped in octagon form. It's very interesting monument architecture wise, because it presents a rare sample of sacral architecture that will serve for studying, as tourism attraction, but also as a religious building encumbered with many tangible and spiritual heritage values.

Bektashi Tekke
The Bektashi Tekke in Gjakova (Đakovica) was established in 1790, and it is the only building of its kind in Kosovo. It is the headquarters of the country's Islamic Sufi order. This building was reconstructed after being demolished during the last Kosovo conflict.
The message of Kosovo's Bektashi spiritual leader, father Mumin Lamas, “Without the homeland there is no religion.” This tekke—or temple—used to be an education center for many generations, but during the last conflict, its rich library was completely destroyed. “Bektashi is known as a mystic belief in the Muslim religion. Its aim is the spiritual sophistication of human kind.”  It does not discriminate by race, gender, language or national origin. In the last war of Kosovo, the Tekke was burnt and destroyed, losing so a library with thousands of book and tens of manuscripts. ""Everything was burnt, including 58 manuscripts. One of them contained 100 pages but there were also 400 pages manuscripts,"" said father Mumin Lama.
On the right side of the temple, seven of Bektashi's nine fathers, who have served in this building since 17th century, are buried. It is worth noting that father Qazim Bakalli, a clever calm man who impressed people with his remarkable wisdom, is buried here.
Home to Gjakova’s mystical Bektashi order, this modern tekke painted in traditional green and white colours was built in 2007 on the foundations of the original. Located in the centre of the Çarshia e Madhe, it's open by appointment, and it's under the leadership of Baba Mumin Lama. Like all other Bektashi tekkes, this one in Gjakova is open for men and women to pray at the same time and is the property of all believers.

Clock tower
Clock tower stands in the historic center of the Grand Bazaar, at a place known as the “Field of the Clock“. According to the Islamic calendar it was built in the year 1002, which is 1597 in the Gregorian calendar. As a town experiencing rapid economic development, Gjakova acquired its clock tower shortly after the construction of the Hadum’s Mosque. The building was destroyed during the Balkan wars (1912). The belfry was removed and transported to Montenegro. A new tower close to the foundations of the previous clock tower was erected recently, with the intention of recreating the original building on the basis of archived photographic material. The tower is a square building with 4.10 m long sides, reaching a height of about 30 m. The construction is mainly of stone, with the walls up to the observation area in a combination of stone and brick: the part of the tower above the observation area is wooden. The roof is covered with lead. On the western facade of this reconstructed tower are some inscribed stones from the original tower.

186,"Grand Bazaar, Isfahan","The Grand Bazaar (Persian: بازار بزرگ, transliterated: Bāzār-e Bozorg)  is a market located in Isfahan, Iran, also known as the Qeysarriyeh Bazaar (بازار قيصريه), Qeysarie bazaar or Soltani bazaar.
The bazaar was one of the greatest and most luxurious trading centers in the Safavid era. It was built in 1620 on the northern side of Naqsh-e Jahan Square. It connects the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Kohneh Square and Seljukid part of Isfahan.

History
It was originally constructed during the 11th century on the southwest wing of the Jameh Mosque and Kohneh Square, but various arcades and rooms were later added. 
The bazaar, one of the oldest and largest in the Middle East, dates to Seljukid and Safavid era and is the longest roofed market in the world.  The site has been destroyed several times and the contemporary bazaar dates to the 17th century. The bazaar is a vaulted two-kilometre street linking the old city with the new.

In the Middle-East, bazaars were typically situated in close proximity to the mosque and the Isfahan Bazaar is no exception. The Bazaar of Isfahan is located in downtown old Isfahan, Iran, in the northern section of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square. The main entrance called Qeisarieh stretches through to Jameh Mosque, the oldest mosque in Isfahan, and one of the oldest in Iran.

189,Bazaar of Saqqez,"The Bazaar of Saqqez is a historical complex and place of trade of various goods between merchants of the region and across Iran, which is located in the center of Saqqez and plays a major role in the trade of various goods between Iran, Iraq and Turkey.

History
This Bazaar is one of the historical places of Rojhalat, which according to the remaining buildings of caravanserais and bazaars such as Tajvanchi Caravanserai and Jewish Bazaar, dates back to the time of Zandieh, which flourished and was restored during the Safavid and Qajar eras. The revival of historical bazaar centers such as Haj Saleh Hammam, Domenareh Mosque and caravanserais and the construction of a historical museum are being studied and carried out.

The structure of the Bazzar
This bazaar consists of two main parts between the Castle bazaar and Sarpacheh bazaar, which are separated by the covered river Vali Khan (now Fakhr Razi Street). Saqqez Bazzar consists of several smaller Bazaars that are divided according to the goods offered and the sellers. These markets include the ""Bazzar of Bala"", which sells luxury goods, and the ""Bazzar of Paein"", which sells traditional goods such as textiles, wedding accessories and agricultural items. There are other markets, such as the Jewish market, which is now home to tailors and clothing manufacturers, and the Kazakhkhaneh market, which is now widely visited by travelers.

Specification
Saqez Bazaar is known as the fabric hub of Iran due to the large number of shops and merchants of textiles and clothing, and this market is one of the main centers for the distribution of textiles and clothing in the region and Iran, with more than 500 main shops and markets of textiles and clothing. Sales of especially Kurdish women's clothing fabrics are active in the complex of shops and markets of the Silk bazaar, behind the Day Bazaar (Kazakhkhaneh), Ardalan Bazaar, Bala Bazaar and Azadi Underpass.

In and around the Ardabil Bazaar are many caravansaries and inns, owned by the estate of the Safavid dynasty shrine, and mosques, some of which were endowed by  Ata-Malik Juvayni (1226–1283) for the Shaykh Safi shrine. The proceeds from the many shops, bathhouses and inns in the bazaar that are owned by the estate of the shrine are used for the shrines upkeep.

193,"Grand Bazaar, Tehran","The Grand Bazaar (Persian: بازار بزرگ Bāzār e Bozorg) is an old historical bazaar in Tehran, Iran. It is split into several corridors over 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in length, each specializing in different types of goods,[1] and has several entrances, with Sabze-Meydan being the main entrance.[2][3]
In addition to shops, the Grand Bazaar contains mosques, guest houses, and banks. It has access to the rapid transit system of Tehran Metro through the stations of Khayam and Khordad 15th.

History
Trade and early bazaars in Tehran
It is hard to say exactly when the bazaar first appeared, but in the centuries after the Muslim conquest of Iran, travelers reported the growth of commerce in the area now occupied by the current bazaar. 
Research indicates that a portion of today's bazaar predated the growth of the village of Tehran by the time of the Safavid Empire, although it was during and after this period that the bazaar began to grow gradually. Western travelers reported that, by 1660 CE and beyond, the bazaar area had still been largely open and only partially covered.[4]

Development
Much of the bazaar itself was constructed much later. However, under the reign of Reza Shah, as Tehran began to grow and reform exponentially in the early 20th century, the changes brought by this rapid development saw much of the bazaar disappear. The old sections of the bazaar are generally similar in architectural style, while the parts added in the 20th century often look different. Critics say that little consideration had been given for the construction of these new sections.

Bazaari
The bazaar is viewed as a force of conservatism in the Iranian society, providing strong links between the clergy and the middle class traders. The 1979 Revolution received strong backing from these forces, and the Grand Bazaar of Tehran was a center for pro-revolutionary feeling and finance.
There were several reasons why the bazaar class worked hard to help advance the revolution. The government of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was anathema to the bazaaris, who seemed set to lose out as the country was being industrialized, and they feared that they would be left behind and their status in society would be reduced. Similarly, another concern for the bazaar class, not just in Tehran but throughout Iran, was that these traditional economic forces did not benefit from the 1974–1978 oil boom, and were thus even more inclined to aid the revolution.[5] As such, the Grand Bazaar of Tehran was a hotbed of support for the revolution, which positioned itself opposite the monarchy. The Grand Bazaar continues largely to support the establishment, particularly as conservative political forces often adopt a low tax, laissez-faire approach to the bazaaris.[6] Today, much of the city's trade and finance has been moved to parts of northern Tehran.

It is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East and the largest covered bazaar in the world. It is one of Iran's UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

History
Tabriz has been a place of cultural exchange since antiquity. Its historic bazaar complex is one of the most important commercial centres on the Silk Road. A bazaar has existed on the same site since the early periods of Iranian urbanism following Islam. The bazaar was mentioned by the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, who claimed to have passed through it while journeying on the Silk Road. 
Al-Maqdisi in 10th century, Yaqut al-Hamawi in ca. 1213 CE, Zakariya al-Qazwini in ca. 1252 CE, Marco Polo in 1271 CE, Odoric of Pordenone in ca. 1321 CE, Ibn Battuta in ca. 1330 CE, Ambrogio Contarini in 1474 CE, Hamdallah Mustawfi in around 13th to 14th century, John Cartwright in 1606 CE, Jean Chardin at the time of Suleiman I of Persia, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in ca. 1636 CE, Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri in ca. 1642 CE and dozens of other explorers and historians have written about the Bazaar of Tabriz, which shows its importance and significance through the different periods of history.
Located in the center of the city of Tabriz, the structure is divided into rows, many devoted to particular categories of product. These include Amir Bazaar (for gold and jewelry), Mozzafarieh (hand woven rugs, sorted by knot size and type), Bashmakhchi Bazaar (shoes), Kiz Basdi Bazaar, and Rahli Bazaar (produce). Tabriz and its bazaar were at their most prosperous in the 16th century, when the town became the capital city of the Safavid kingdom. The city lost this status in the 17th century, but its bazaar has remained important as a commercial and economic hub in the region and on the silk road. Although numerous modern shops and malls have been established in recent years, Tabriz Bazaar has kept its vital role as economic hub of the city and northwestern Iran.
The bazaar was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2010.

Ceremonies
The bazaar is used for some important religious ceremonies.

Restoration
In 2000, the Historical Hermitages Organization of Iran begin a restoration project of the Bazaar, with the full participation of the shop owners. The rehabilitation project won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2013.

196,List of bazaars in Iran,"A bazaar or souk, is a permanently enclosed marketplace or street where goods and services are exchanged or sold.
The term bazaar originates from the Persian word bāzār. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer to the ""network of merchants, bankers and craftsmen"" who work in that area. Although the word ""bazaar"" is of Persian origin, its use has spread and now has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world.
The term souk (Arabic: سوق suq, Hebrew: שוק shuq, Syriac: ܫܘܩܐ shuqa, Armenian: շուկա shuka, Spanish: zoco, also spelled souq, shuk, shooq, soq, esouk, succ, suk, sooq, suq, soek) is used in Western Asian, North African and some Horn African cities (Amharic: ሱቅ sooq).

198,Pervane Medrese,"Pervane Medrese (Turkish: Pervane Medresesi) is a historic madrasa, an Islamic school, in Sinop, Turkey.
It is situated in the center of the Sinop Peninsula. Another  historical building, the Alaaddin Mosque is to the south of the madrasa, across the road between the two.

Background
Mu'in al-Din Sulaiman Parwana, better known as Pervâne, was a vizier during the dissolution period of the Anatolian Seljuks in the second half of the 13th century. In 1262, he recaptured Sinop from the Trebizond Empire. The sultan granted Sinop to Pervane as an iqta, a fief. Although a vassal of the Seljuks, Pervane became de facto ruler of Sinop. He built the madrasa in 1265. After Perwana, the madrasa was used during the Candar beylik and Ottoman Empire. After the proclamation of the Turkish Republic,  madrasas were replaced by modern schools, and the Pervane Medrese was closed. From 1932 on, the madrasa building was used as a depot for archaeological artifacts and ethnographical items collected since 1921. It was established as a museum in 1941, which lasted until 1970 when the museum was moved to its new building. In 2002, the building was handed over to Sinop governorship. It is now used as a souvenir shop bazaar.

Architecture
The building with the dimensions  38 m × 28 m (125 ft × 92 ft) lies in the north to south direction. A marble portal is the main entrance in the south. There are two rooms on each side of the portal. Five student cells each are situated on both side of the building. In the courtyard, there  is a fountain. The tombs of an admiral (Gazi Chelebi) and his daughter are also at the madrasa.

199,"List of streets, hans and gates in Grand Bazaar, Istanbul","The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul has four main gates situated at the ends of its two major streets which intersect near the southwestern corner of the bazaar. One street connects the Bayezid II Mosque and Beyazıt Square with the Nuruosmaniye Mosque. As everywhere in the East, traders of the same type of good were forcibly concentrated along one road, which got its name from their profession. The names of the streets in the Grand Bazaar give us precious information about the goods and the profession in use during the Ottoman Empire.

200,Spice Bazaar,"The Spice Bazaar (Turkish: Mısır Çarşısı, meaning ""Egyptian Bazaar"") in Istanbul, Turkey, is one of the largest bazaars in the city. Located in the Eminönü quarter of the Fatih district, it is the most famous covered shopping complex after the Grand Bazaar.

History
There are several documents  suggesting that the name of the bazaar was first ""New Bazaar"". Then it got its name ""Egyptian Bazaar"" (Turkish: Mısır Çarşısı) because it was built with the revenues from the Ottoman eyalet of Egypt in 1660. The word mısır has a double meaning in Turkish: ""Egypt"" and ""maize"". This is why sometimes the name is wrongly translated as ""Corn Bazaar"". The bazaar was (and still is) the center for spice trade in Istanbul, but in recent years shops of other types are gradually replacing the sellers of spices.
The building itself is part of the külliye (complex) of the New Mosque. The revenues obtained from the rented shops inside the bazaar building were used for the upkeeping of the mosque. 
The structure was designed by the court architect Koca Kasım Ağa, but the construction works began under the supervision of another court architect, Mustafa Ağa, in the last months of 1660; following Istanbul's Great Fire of 1660 that began on 24 July 1660 and, lasting for slightly more than two days (circa 49 hours, according to the chronicles of Abdi Pasha), destroyed many neighbourhoods in the city. A major rebuilding and redevelopment effort started in the city following the fire, which included the resumption of the New Mosque's construction works in 1660 (halted between 1603 and 1660, the construction of the mosque was ultimately completed between 1660 and 1665) and the beginning of the Spice Bazaar's construction in the same year (all buildings in the New Mosque külliye, including the Spice Bazaar, were commissioned by Sultana Turhan Hatice, the Valide Sultan (Queen Mother) of Sultan Mehmed IV.)

Egyptian Bazaar today
Spice Bazaar has a total of 85 shops selling spices, Turkish delight and other sweets, jewellery, souvenirs, and dried fruits and nuts.

201,Tahtakale Hamam,"The Tahtakale Hamam (English: Tahtakale Baths) is a historic Ottoman hammam (public bathhouse; Turkish: hamam) building in Istanbul, Turkey, close to the Rüstem Pasha Mosque in the Tahtakale neighbourhood, between the Grand Bazaar and Eminönü. Built during the reign of Sultan Mehmet II, it is one of the oldest surviving bathhouses in the city. After  having suffered significant damage while being used as a storage depot in the 20th century, the building was restored in the late 1980s and now serves as a local shopping centre and cafe.

History
The hamam is mentioned in the waqf document of the Fatih Mosque in 1470–1471 (875 AH), indicating that it was built between 1453 (the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople) and 1471. Turkish scholar Doğan Kuban argues that the hamam was likely built at the same time as the Eski Saray (Old Palace), which Mehmet II built immediately after the conquest and which was located nearby in what is now the Beyazıt district. This would date the hamam to just after 1453 and would thus make it the oldest surviving hamam structure in the city. The only other documented hamams in the city which date from the time of Mehmet II are the Mahmut Pasha Hamam (part of the Mahmut Pasha Mosque's complex) built in 1466 and the Gedik Ahmet Pasha Hamam built around 1475.
The Tahtakale Hamam continued to serve as a bathhouse until possibly the early 1900s. It survived, but may have been damaged by, the 1894 earthquake as well as a major fire in the area in 1911. Afterwards the building was used as a deep freeze storage and cheese depot, which contributed to the deterioration of its historic fabric. A large section of the building's interior was destroyed and replaced with a modern structure with concrete floors, leaving only a part of the former men's baths and the cold room of the former women's baths still standing.
Eventually, the owner of the building decided to restore it and find another use for it. In 1988 (or 1989) a major restoration project began, lasting until 1992. The concrete structures were removed and the bathhouse's original floor plan was re-established. During the restoration, it was decided that the building would be converted into a commercial centre to ensure its economic viability. Since much of the building's original appearance could not be reconstructed without significant speculation, it was decided to use different restoration methods and principles for different parts of the building. Surviving elements were preserved while some details which had vanished were left unreconstructed, and new elements were added to enable the building's adaptation into a commercial centre with multiple shops. The former changing room of the men's baths, under the largest dome, became the main entrance and was outfitted with new galleries and a central fountain in homage to the original layout. Likewise, a new monumental entrance portal, in a simplified Ottoman style, was built in place of the original one which had disappeared without any visual documentation to facilitate its reconstruction. The building still serves as a local shopping centre, the Tahtakale Hamamı Çarşısı (Tahtakale Hamam Market), within the larger commercial district stretching north from the Grand Bazaar area.

Architecture
The building was a large double hamam with separate sections for men and women, each with their own sequence of changing room and steam rooms. The women's section, on the south side, was slightly smaller and narrower in plan than the men's section. It originally had its own entrance alongside the men's on the main street (to the east), but this entrance has not been preserved. The entrance to the men's section serves as the building's main entrance today, featuring a reconstructed portal with a tall monumental aspect and some muqarnas decoration. Another small entrance on the building's south side was added during its conversion into a shopping centre. 
The rest of the building's floor plan has been preserved or reconstructed, with each section having a large changing room or cold room (equivalent to the apodyterium and frigidarium of Roman baths), followed by a warm room and then a hot room, with a service area for the furnaces at the back of the bathhouse now serving as a corridor to link the two sections. The hot rooms have fairly elaborate designs with multiple domed areas. The hot room of the men's section has a large central dome and is flanked by four smaller rooms on either side (almost all covered by their own domes). It also features four halvets (private areas reserved for special guests), giving this hamam one of the most advanced designs of its time.
The square-plan changing room of the men's section (now the main entrance) has the largest dome, measuring nearly 17 metres (56 ft) in diameter. The corners of the dome have muqarnas squinches, similar to those in the hamams of Edirne and Bursa built around the same period. While the original building was probably more extensively decorated, not much of this has survived and it could not be reconstituted during the restoration. The building's exterior is marked by a distinctive silhouette of domes with many pierced skylights and lanterns, visible from the surrounding roofs.

202,Yeni Kavaflar Market,"Yeni Kavaflar Market (Turkish: Yeni Kavaflar Çarşısı) is a covered bazaar in İzmir, Turkey.

Location
The market, situated at 38°25′20″N 27°8′9″E, is to the south of Fevzipaşa Boulevard and to the north of Kemeraltı Bazaar at Çankaya neighborhood of Konak district in Izmir.  The 130 m (430 ft)-long west to east dimension of the market lies in parallel to the boulevard. There are 64 shops in the market.

History
During the Great fire of İzmir in 1922, just after the liberation of İzmir, most of the İzmir business center were burned down. In İzmir Economic Congress held on 17 February 1923-4 March 1923, reconstruction of the business center was planned. The Yeni Kavaflar Market was a part of this project and it was  completed in 1929. In 2009, it was restored by the Municipality of Konak, a secondary municipality of İzmir. Although the name Yeni Kavaflar means ""New Shoemakers"", there are many shops of diverse sectors such as leather dealers, furniture shops etc.

203,"Grand Bazaar, Istanbul","The Grand Bazaar (Turkish: Kapalıçarşı, meaning ‘Covered Market’; also Büyük Çarşı, meaning ‘Grand Market’) in Istanbul is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world, with 61 covered streets and over 4,000 shops on a total area of 30,700 m2, attracting between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily. In 2014, it was listed No.1 among the world's most-visited tourist attractions with 91,250,000 annual visitors. The Grand Bazaar at Istanbul is often regarded as one of the first shopping malls of the world.

Location
The Grand Bazaar is located inside the walled city of Istanbul, in the district of Fatih and in the neighbourhood (mahalle) bearing the same name (Kapalıçarşı). It stretches roughly from west to east between the mosques of Beyazit and of Nuruosmaniye. The Bazaar can easily be reached from Sultanahmet  and Sirkeci by trams (Beyazıt-Kapalıçarşı stop).

History
The construction of the future Grand Bazaar's core started during the winter of 1455/56, shortly after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and was part of a broader initiative to stimulate economic prosperity in Istanbul. Sultan Mehmed II had an edifice erected devoted to the trading of textiles and jewels near his palace in Constantinople. It was named Cevâhir Bedestan (""Bedesten of Gems"") and was also known as Bezzâzistan-ı Cedîd (""New Bedesten"") in Ottoman Turkish. The word bedesten is adapted from the Persian word bezestan, derived from bez (""cloth""), and means ""bazaar of the cloth sellers"". The building – named alternately in Turkish İç (""Internal""), Antik (""Ancient""), or Eski (""Old"") Bedesten – lies on the slope of the third hill of Istanbul, between the ancient Fora of Constantine and of Theodosius. It was also near the first sultan's palace, the Old Palace (Eski Saray), which was also in construction in those same years, and not far from the Artopoleia (in Greek) (Ἀρτοπωλεῖα), the city's bakers' quarter in Byzantine times.

The construction of the Bedesten ended in the winter of 1460/61, and the building was endowed to the waqf of the Hagia Sophia Mosque. Analysis of the brickwork shows that most of the structure originates from the second half of the 15th century, although a Byzantine relief representing a Comnenian eagle, still enclosed on the top of the East Gate (Kuyumcular Kapısı)) of the Bedesten has been used by several scholars as proof that the edifice was a Byzantine structure.
In a market near the Bedesten, named in Turkish Esir Pazarı, the slave trade was active, a use also carried over from Byzantine times. Other important markets in the vicinity were the second-hand market (Turkish: Bit Pazarı), the ""Long Market"" (Uzun Çarşı), corresponding to the Greek Makros Embolos (Μακρὸς Ἔμβολος, ""Long Portico""), a long porticoed mall stretching downhill from the Forum of Constantine to the Golden Horn, which was one of the main market areas of the city, while the old book market (Sahaflar Çarşısı) was moved from the Bazaar to the present picturesque location near the Beyazid Mosque only after the 1894 Istanbul earthquake.
Some years later —according to other sources, this occurred in 1545 under Sultan Suleiman I—Mehmed II had another covered market built, the ""Sandal Bedesten"" (the name comes from a kind of thread woven in Bursa, which had the colour of sandalwood), also named Küçük (""Little""), Cedit or Yeni (both words meaning ""New"") Bedesten, which lay north of the first.
After the erection of the Sandal Bedesten the trade in textiles moved there, while the Cevahir Bedesten was reserved for the trade in luxury goods. At the beginning the two buildings were isolated. According to the 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles, between them and the Mosque of Beyazid stood the ruins of churches and a large cistern. However, soon many sellers opened their shops between and around them, so that a whole quarter was born, devoted exclusively to commerce.
At the beginning of the 17th century the Grand Bazaar had already achieved its final shape. The enormous extent of the Ottoman Empire in three continents, and the total control of road communications between Asia and Europe, rendered the Bazaar and the surrounding hans or caravanserais the hub of the Mediterranean trade. According to several European travelers, at that time, and until the first half of the 19th century, the market was unrivaled in Europe with regards to the abundance, variety and quality of the goods on sale. At that time we know from European travelers that the Grand Bazaar had a square plan, with two perpendicular main roads crossing in the middle and a third road running along the outer perimeter. In the Bazaar there were 67 roads (each bearing the name of the sellers of a particular good), several squares used for the daily prayers, 5 mosques, 7 fountains, 18 gates which were opened each day in the morning and closed in the evening. Around 1638 the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi gave us the most important historical description of the Bazaar and of its customs. The number of shops amounted to 3,000, plus 300 located in the surrounding hans, large caravanserais with two or three stories round a porticoed inner courtyard, where goods could be stored and merchants could be lodged. In that period one tenth of the shops of the city were concentrated in the market and around it. For all that, at that time the market was not yet covered.

Recurrent calamities, fires and earthquakes hit the Grand Bazaar. The first fire occurred in 1515; another in 1548. Other fires ravaged the complex in 1588, 1618 (when the Bit Pazarı was destroyed), 1645, 1652, 1658, 1660 (on that occasion the whole city was devastated), 1687, 1688 (great damage occurred to the Uzun Çarşı) 1695, and 1701.  The fire of 1701 was particularly fierce, forcing Grand Vizier Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha to rebuild several parts of the complex in 1730–1731. In 1738 the Kızlar Ağası Beşir Ağa endowed the Fountain (still existing) near Mercan Kapı.
In this period, because of the new law against fires issued in 1696, several parts of the market which lay between the two Bedesten were covered with vaults. Despite that, other fires ravaged the complex in 1750 and 1791. The quake of 1766 caused more damages, which were repaired by the Court Chief Architect (Hassa Baş Mimarı) Ahmet a year later.
The 19th-century growth of the textile industry in western Europe, introduction of mass production methods, the capitulations signed between the Empire and many European countries, and the forestalling – always by European merchants – of the raw materials needed to produce goods in the Empire's closed economy, were factors which caused the Market's decline. By 1850, rents in Bedesten were ten times lower than two to three decades before. Moreover, the birth of a West-oriented bourgeoisie and the commercial success of Western products pushed the merchants belonging to the minorities (Greek, Armenian, Jewish) into moving out of the Bazaar, perceived as antiquated, and into opening new shops in quarters frequented by Europeans, such as Pera and Galata.
According to an 1890 survey, in the Bazaar there were 4,399 active shops, 2 bedesten, 2195 rooms, 1 hamam, one mosque, 10 medrese, 19 fountains (among them two şadırvan and one sebil), one mausoleum and 24 han. In the 30.7 hectares of the complex, protected by 18 gates, there are 3,000 shops along 61 streets, the 2 bedesten, 13 han (plus several more outside).
The last major catastrophe happened in 1894: a strong earthquake that rocked Istanbul. The Minister of Public Works, Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, supervised the repair of the damaged Bazaar until 1898, and on this occasion the complex was reduced in area. To the west, the Bit Pazarı was left outside the new perimeter and became an open-sky road, named Çadırcılar Caddesi (""Tentmaker Road""), while the old gate and the Kütkculer Kapi were demolished. Among all the hans which belonged to the Market, many were left outside, and only nine remained enclosed in the structure.
In 1914 the Sandal Bedesten, whose handlers of textile goods had been ruined by the European competition, was acquired by the city of Istanbul and, starting one year later, was used as an auction house, mainly for carpets. In 1927 the individual parts of the bazaar and the streets got official names. The last fires of bazaar happened in 1943 and 1954, and the related restorations were finished on 28 July 1959.
The last restoration of the complex took place in 1980. On that occasion, advertising posters around the market were also removed.

Architecture
The Iç Bedesten has a rectangular plan (43.30 m x 29.50 m). Two rows of stone piers, four in each row, sustain three rows of bays, five in each row. Each bay is surmounted by a brick dome with blind drum. In the inner and in the outer walls have been built 44 cellars (Turkish: mahzen), vaulted rooms without external openings. The sunlight in Bedesten comes from rectangular  windows placed right under the roof: they can be accessed through a wooden ambulatory. Due to the scarce illumination, the edifice was kept open only some hours each day, and was devoted to the trade of luxury goods, above all textiles. Moreover, the Bedesten's Mahzen were also used as safes. The building can be accessed through four gates: 

""Second-hand Book Sellers' Gate"" (Sahaflar Kapısı) in the north,
""Skullcap Sellers' Gate"" (Takkeciler Kapısı) in the south,
""Jewellers' Gate"" (Kuyumcular Kapısı) in the east, and;
""Women's Clothiers' Gate"" (Zenneciler Kapısı) in the west.

The Sandal Bedesten has also a rectangular plan (40.20 m × 42.20 m), with 12 stone piers bearing 20 bays surmounted by brick domes with blind drum. In this case shops are carved only in the outer walls. In both edifices, each bay is tied to the others through brick arches tied by juniper beams, and masonry is made with rubble. Both buildings were closed by iron gates.
Aside from the bedestens, originally the Grand Bazaar structures were built with wood, and only after the 1700 fire, they were rebuilt in stone and brickwork, and covered. All the bazaar edifices, except the fur dealers market (Turkish: Kürkçüler Çarsısı), a later addition which is two-story, are one story. The roofs are mainly covered with tiles, while the part burnt in 1954 uses now tarmac. In the bazaar no artificial light was foreseen, also to prevent fires, and smoking was strictly prohibited. The roads outside the inner Bedesten are roughly parallel to it. The damages caused by the many fires and quakes along the centuries, together with the repairs done without a general plan, gave to the market – especially in its western part – a picturesque appearance, with its maze of roads and lanes crossing each other at various angles.

Social history of the Grand Bazaar
Until the restoration following the quake of 1894, the Grand Bazaar had no shops as found in the western world: along both sides of the roads merchants sat on wooden divans in front of their shelves. Each of them occupied a space 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) in width, and 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) in depth. This was named in Turkish dolap, meaning 'stall'. The most precious merchandise was not on display, but kept in cabinets. Only clothes were hung in long rows, with a picturesque effect. A prospective client could sit in front of the dealer, talk with him and drink a tea or a Turkish coffee, in a relaxed way. At the end of the day, each stall was closed with drapes. Another peculiarity was the complete lack of advertising. Moreover, as everywhere in the East, traders of the same type of goods were forcibly concentrated along one road, which got its name from their profession. The Inner Bedesten hosted the most precious wares: jewelers, armourers, crystal dealers had their shops there. The Sandal Bedesten was mainly the center of the silk trade, but also other goods were on sale there. The most picturesque parts of the market were – apart from the two Bedestens – the shoe market (Turkish: Pabuççular Pazarı), where thousands of shoes of different colors (Ottoman sumptuary laws prescribed yellow shoes for Muslims, blue for Greek Orthodox, black for Jews and red for Armenians) were on display on high shelves; the spice and herbs market (later concentrated in the Egyptian Bazaar), which stood near the jewelers; the armour and weapon market; the old book market; and the flea market.
This kind of organization disappeared gradually, although nowadays a concentration of the same business along certain roads can be observed again:

Jewellers and gold bracelets along Kalpakçılar Caddesi;
Gold bracelets along Kuyumcular Çarşısı;
Furniture along Divrikli Caddesi;
Carpets along Sahaflar Caddesi;
Leather goods along Perdahçılar Caddesi
Leather and casual clothes at the Bit Pazarı.
Actually, the main reason of concentrating the trade in one place was to provide the highest security against theft, fire and uprising. The goods in the Bedesten were guaranteed against everything except turmoil. Gates were always closed at night, and the bazaar was patrolled by guards paid by the merchants' guilds. In order to access the complex during night hours, an imperial edict was required. The only official night opening in the history of the Bazaar occurred in 1867 during the feast organized for the return of Sultan Abdülaziz from Egypt, when the sovereign crossed the illuminated market riding a horse among the rejoicing populace. Despite the immense wealth present in the Bazaar over the centuries—as an English traveller recorded as late as c. 1870, a tour of the inner Bedesten could easily ruin a few Rothschild families—theft occurred extremely rarely. The most important such incident happened in 1591, when 30,000 gold coins (Turkish: Altın) were stolen in the old Bedesten. The theft shocked the whole of Istanbul, the Bazaar remained closed for two weeks and people were tortured, until the money was found hidden under a floor matting. The culprit was a young Persian musk seller. Thanks to the intercession of the Sultan Murad III he was executed by hanging and not by torture.
The ethics of trade in the Market until the Tanzimat age (i.e. until the mid-19th century) were quite different from the modern ones: indifference to profit, absence of envy in the successes of other traders, and a single and correct price were peculiar traits of the Ottoman bazaar during its golden age. The reason for such behavior lies partly in the ethics of Islam, and partly in the guild system which provided a strong social security net to the merchants. Afterwards, the westernization of the Ottoman society and the influence of the national minorities caused the introduction of mercantile ethics in Ottoman society.

Right during the westernization of Ottoman society, the Grand Bazaar became an obligatory topos of the romantic literature. We owe descriptions of the Bazaar in the middle of the 19th century to writers such as Edmondo De Amicis and Théophile Gautier.
Another peculiarity of the market during the Ottoman age was the total lack of restaurants. The absence of women in the social life and the nomadic conventions in the Turkish society made the concept of restaurant alien. Merchants brought their lunch in a food box called sefertas, and the only food on sale was simple dishes such as doner kebab, tavuk göğsü (a dessert prepared with chicken breast, milk sugar and rose water sprinkled on it) and Turkish coffee. These simple dishes were prepared and served in small two-story kiosks placed in the middle of a road. The most famous among these kiosks is the one—still extant but not functioning any more—placed at the crossing of Halıcılar Caddesi and Acı Çesme Caddesi. It is alleged that Sultan Mahmud II came there often in disguise to eat his pudding. The Bazaar was in the Ottoman Age the place where the Istanbullu (the inhabitants of the city) could see each other. Not only was the market the only place in town where the ladies could go relatively easily (and this circumstance made the place especially interesting for the Europeans who visited the city), but—especially from the Tanzimat age on—it was also the only public place where the average citizen had a chance to meet the members of the Imperial Harem and of the Court casually.
The Bazaar's merchants were organized in guilds. In order to establish a new one, it was only necessary to have enough traders of the same good. Afterwards, a monopoly was formed and the number of traders and shops was frozen. One could only be accepted in the guild through co-optation, either as son of a deceased member, or after paying a suitable sum to a member who wanted to retire.
The guild's chief was a public officer called Kethüda. He was paid by the guild but appointed by the Kadı of Istanbul. Fixation of prices and taxes were matter of the Kethüda. He was joined by a representative of the guild's member, called Yiğitbaşı ('chief of the brave young fellows'). These two officers were flanked by the assembly of the elders, non necessarily old in age, but comprising the most experienced traders. Parallel to the guilds, there were purely religious organizations, called fütüvvet tariks. Their members met in Dervish shrines and performed religious functions. These organizations became less and less important with time due to the increased weight of the Greek, Armenian and Jews merchants in the bazaar's trade. Each guild had a financial department which collected a moderate monthly fee (some silver coins; Turkish: Kuruş) from the members and administered it taking care of the needs of each associated person. The guilds lost increasingly their importance during the Tanzimat period, and were abolished in 1913, being replaced by an association of Bazaar merchants. Nowadays, there are several merchant associations in the Bazaar, but none is representative of the whole seller community.

The Grand Bazaar today
Today the Grand Bazaar is a thriving complex, employing 26,000 people visited by between 250,000 and 400,000 visitors daily, and one of the major landmarks of Istanbul. It must compete with modern shopping malls common in Istanbul, but its beauty and fascination represent a formidable advantage for it. The head of the Grand Bazaar Artisans Association claimed that the complex was in 2011 – the year of its 550th birthday – the most visited monument in the world. A restoration project starting in 2012 should renew its infrastructure, heating and lighting systems. Moreover, the hans inside the Market will be renovated and later additions will be demolished. This project should finally solve the big problems of the market: for example, in the whole Bazaar there is no proper toilet facility. Moreover, the lack of controls in the past years allowed many dealers to remove columns and skive walls in their shops to gain space; this, together with the substitution of lead (stolen in the last years) with concrete on the market's roof, has created a great hazard when the earthquake expected in Istanbul in the next years will occur.
The Grand Bazaar is opened each day except Sundays and bank holidays from 9:00 until 19:00.

204,Kemeraltı,"Kemeraltı (more fully, Kemeraltı Çarşısı) is a historical market (bazaar) district of İzmir, Turkey. It remains one of the liveliest districts of İzmir.

Location
The district covers a vast area extending from the level of the Agora of Smyrna (the quarters of Namazgah, Mezarlıkbaşı and İkiçeşmelik), to the seashore along the Konak Square.
It is bounded by the streets Fevzipaşa Boulevard on the northeast, Eşrefpaşa Street on the southwest, and Halil Rıfat Bashaw Street on the southeast, surrounded by ridges of Kadifekale.

History
The bazaar formed originally around a long street. In medieval times, it was called Street of the Mevlevis, in reference to the presence of a ""dergah"" (a building designed for gatherings of a Sufi brotherhood). During the 17th Century, this street was filled in, which allowed the bazaar to extend. Today, the street, now called Anafartalar Caddesi (""Anafartalar Street""), winds to complete the circle of the shallow inner bay in a wide curve.

16th century
A milestone in the bazaar's development was the building in 1592 of the Hisar Mosque (""Fortress Mosque""). This is the oldest, most significant Ottoman landmark in İzmir (although built by Aydınoğlu Yakup Bey, descendant of the dynasty that had founded the Beylik, whose family the (Aydinids) had controlled İzmir prior to Ottoman conquest). ""Fortress"" in the name of the mosque refers to its predecessor, the Genoese Castle or Fortress of ""San Pietro"", earlier called Neon Kastron in Byzantine times, which stood on the same location. Final remains of the castle were removed during construction of new port installations (1867–1876).

17th century
The market itself came into existence with the filling between 1650–1670 of the shallowest parts of the inner bay. The process of gaining ground from the bay was pursued in 1744 with the construction of Kızlarağası Han, an impressive caravanserai (and surviving to the present) that emerged as the nucleus of the market, together with two older ""hans"", the term implying a caravanserai with more markedly urban characteristics, that have not survived to this day. These was the ""Great Vezir Han"" constructed by the 17th-century grand vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, and the neighboring ""Little Vezir Han"" constructed by his successor Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha. Another historically important han (that no longer exists) was ""Cezayir Han"" (literally ""Han of Algiers""), from where western Anatolia's excess labor force had been annually dispatched to the Ottoman protectorate of Algiers for centuries.

18th-19th centuries
The remaining part of the inner bay silted up throughout the 18th century. The shoreline facing Kemeraltı took its present straight form in the beginning of the 19th century, although some of the land along the berth remained unused until the end of that century. In 1829, Sarı Kışla, the Yellow Barracks, the principal Ottoman barracks of the city, gigantic for its time, was built immediately on the sea-side, and a private residence (konak), situated slightly diagonally behind the barracks, was extended and converted into the governor's mansion, demarcating Konak Square that holds its name from the mansion, and which in its turn gave the name to the central metropolitan district of İzmir (Konak) and at the level of which Kemeraltı is considered to start.

20th century
After the 1922 Great Fire of Smyrna and thereafter, of hundreds of ""hans"" that Kemeraltı counted at the beginning of the 20th century (and clearly visible on a 1905 map drawn by French cartographers on behalf of international insurance companies), only a dozen remained, in full or in part: most were destroyed.
The governor's mansion still stands, although the Yellow Barracks was demolished in 1955 under instructions from the then Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who wanted to see Konak Square re-shaped, to the ongoing regret of many İzmirians who had come to adopt the oversize building as one of the main landmarks of their city.

21st century
Though the loss of shoe manufacturing in the 1990s left a void in the business well into the 2000s, eventually the commercial activities in Kemeraltı recuperated with the growth of Izmir's population throughout the 2010s. In 2020, Kemeraltı became a Tentative World Heritage Site as part of ""The Historical Port City of Izmir.""

Mosques
Kemeraltı is home to Başdurak Mosque, Hisar Mosque, Kemeraltı Mosque, Kestanepazarı Mosque, Salepçioğlu Mosque, and Şadırvanaltı Mosque.

Synagogues
In 2004, the World Monuments Fund added ""Central Izmir Synagogues"" as #81 to its World Monuments Watch annual list. The fund states: Hidden behind walls and gardens, along the alleyways of the colorful historic bazaar, the Central Izmir Synagogues are an unparalleled testament to the city’s rich Jewish heritage. The oldest district in Izmir, Kemeralti dates back to Roman times and is home to the densest concentration of Jewish landmarks in all of Turkey. The six mosques surrounding the synagogue complex evince the centuries of peaceful co-habitation among the local Ottoman and Jewish communities. A heritage organization, the ""Izmir Project"" (planned and partly funded by the Mordechai Kiriaty Foundation, the Izmir-Konak municipality, the Izmir Sephardic Cultural Heritage Association (ISCHA), and the American Friends of Izmir Jewish Heritage Museum) calls Izmir ""the only city in the world in which an unusual cluster of synagogues bearing a typical medieval Spanish architectural style is preserved."" At its peak, there were 34 synagogues in Izmir, ""creating an historical architectural complex unique in the world."" There, Sephardic Jews, originally expelled from Spain and Portugal (e.g., by the Alhambra Decree (or Edict of Expulsion) of 31 March 1492) came to Izmir with their Sephardic Jewish heritage, Ladino language, Sephardic traditions of worship.
This heritage included Sephardic architectural styles of synagogues that came from medieval Spain. The World Monuments Fund notes that Izmir synagogues often feature a “triple arrangement” of the Torah ark, ""which creates a unique harmonious ambience."" The central positioning of the bimah (elevated platform) between four columns divides synagogues into nine parts. The Izmir Project notes that this style features central stage upon which the ark for the Torah rests across the holy chest at the eastern wall. It includes a central platform, supported by four pillars that resemble a canopy for a ceiling. Seating around the stage allows members of a congregation to see each other's faces and adds to the bonding experience of public prayer (in contrast to Ashkenazi architectural style, in which seating lies in rows that limits eye contact).
A documentary film called Hidden Secrets of the Ancient Synagogues of Izmir presents a history and film some of the synagogues. A second documentary called About the Izmir Delegation shows some of the synagogues amidst discussions by Israel Jews about how to preserve them.
In addition to synagogues, there were at least four Jewish mezarliği (cemeteries): Gürçeşme, Bahribaba, Bornova, and Altındağ. A main attraction of Gurcesme is ""the grave of Rabbi Palaggi, which was moved to this cemetery from its original burial place, in the 1920s... and people from all over the world come to pray at his grave"" as ""pilgrimage to Rabbi Palaggi’s grave."" In 2013, a new, perhaps fifth Jewish cemetery.

Remaining synagogues
Of the 34 synagogues, eight remain today in the Kemeraltı Çaršisi area of Izmir (mostly on Havra Sokagi) and another 10 nearby. Some remain intact, some in ruins, and others are in the process of restoration. ""These synagogues constitute a living testimony to the history of the community in Izmir, which was one of the most spectacular of its kind and had the most spiritual and cultural influence on all Jewish diaspora communities in the 17th and 18th centuries.""
The remaining synagogues in or near the bazaar are:

Ashkenazi Synagogue (20th-century, unrestored, inactive)
Beit Hillel Synagogue (Avraham Palache Synagogue) (19th-century, restored 2014, inactive)
Bikur Holim Synagogue (18th-century, restored, active)

205,"Taşhan, Mut","Taşhan is a historical caravanserai in Mersin Province, Turkey.
It is situated in Mut ilçe (district) of Mersin Province to the south of Mut Castle  at 36°38′38″N 33°26′09″E.
The caravanserai was constructed in 1723-1725 by an Ottoman mutasarrıf (governor) named Hacı Sunullah Pasha. It is a rectangular-plan caravanserai. After the period of caravans the caravanserai was used as a local bazaar. But for the last 30 years, it was out of commission.
In 2020 Mersin Metropolitan Municipality and Arslan family (the owner of building) decided to open the bazaar as a Producer Women’s  market. The opening ceremony was held on 26 September 2020. Mersin metropolitan mayor Vahap Seçer as well as Mut mayor Volkan Şeker and the owner of the building were present in the ceremony. The honoured quest was folk musician Musa Eroğlu.

207,Kissariat al-Kifah,"The Kissariat al-Kifah (Arabic: قيسارية الكفاح) or Kissaria (القيسارية) is the historic central bazaar of Fes el-Bali, the historic old city of Fez, Morocco. It is located between the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Qarawiyyin Mosque.

History
The bazaar has been established here since the early Idrisid period of the city (9th-10th centuries). However, its streets and houses were rebuilt at least once after the double devastation of a fire in 1324 and a flood in 1325. Since the 15th century, the bazaar was situated inside what the Muslims of the city considered the horm (sacred sanctuary) of the nearby Zawiya of Moulay Idris II. Accordingly, non-Muslims and animals were traditionally not allowed to enter this area – at least in theory, and especially during times of religious tension.: 374 
After another fire in modern times, probably in 1918, the former wooden roof was replaced with a flat roofing made of reeds, similar to that found in some other North African cities of the time.: 315  Roger Le Tourneau, a French historian who published a history of pre-colonial Fez in 1949, noted that the shops of the Kissaria had a slightly more luxurious appearance than those of other market streets in the city, with their wooden shutters sometimes carved with decorative lines or their ceilings sometimes painted.: 317 

Further renovations in the 20th century replaced the reed roofs with flat concrete roofs. The most recent renovations, in 2016 and 2017, replaced the street roofs with new wooden roofs, made various repairs and practical improvements, and added tile decoration along the lower walls.

Layout and function

The Kissaria (a term also used in other parts of the Islamic world and also transliterated from Arabic as qaysariyya) is interconnected with the Souq al-'Attarin and consists of a close network of lanes and alleys which are filled with hundreds of shops. It is only one part of a larger commercial district and of a network of souqs (markets) across the city, but was traditionally the most prestigious and most central commercial complex, where the most luxurious goods were sold.  This arrangement of a planned bazaar at heart of the city, near its most important religious and civic monuments, was typical of many major cities in the Islamic world.
Unlike most markets in historic Fes, the Kissaria consists of a grid-like network of streets roughly parallel or perpendicular to each other, completely filled with shops and without any residential structures. It is delimited to the north by the Souq al-'Attarin, to the east by the street bordering the Qarawiyyin Mosque, to the west by the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II, and to the south by the Souq al-Shamma'in.: 374  A number of funduqs (merchant inns and warehouses) are also found nearby, such as the Funduq al-Shamma'in.
Traditionally, different streets or sections of streets in the bazaar were specialized for different products, such as clothes, silks, babouches (traditional slippers), and jewelry. Some goods were sold by auctions that took place at specific times of the day.: 374  Historically, every entrance to the Kissaria was also equipped with doors that were shut and locked at night to protect the merchandise inside. Only the porters (zerzaya) were allowed to remain here overnight in order to patrol the streets.: 374

208,Chappan Dukan,"Chappan Dukan (Chhappan Dukan/56 Dukan) is a food and shopping Street located in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. It is known for its active street food scene and variety of shops, establishing itself as a notable landmark for residents and visitors alike.
Chappan Dukaan accommodates 56 food shops within a distance of approximately 200 meters, situated in the upscale Palasia area of Indore.

History
Until 1974, the area was referred to as the Udasin Ashram Market. It was a sparsely wooded region lacking specialized facilities. The local administration of Indore recognized the need for improvement. Consequently, a market was established for the vendors, consisting of 56 shops. This market was officially recorded in government records under the name Udasin Ashram Market. Vendors engaged in mobile businesses were allotted these shops at a cost of 2500 rupees each. The dimensions of these shops were a mere six by eight, allowing space for a handcart. During that period, the market primarily catered to the retail sale of items like vegetables. However, with time, new individuals acquired these shops and introduced a variety of offerings.
Between the 1980s and 1990s, the Chappan Dukan area became synonymous with Indore and earned the moniker ""56 Dukan"". In 2000, a major transformation took place which made widespread recognition across Madhya Pradesh and the nation. The market's popularity attracted celebrities, officials, and leaders, who frequently included it in their Indore visits, sometimes accompanied by their families.
In 2020, Chappan Dukan was redeveloped into a smart food street by Indore Smart City Development Limited (ISCDL), with the project costing approximately ₹4 crore (40 million rupees). The area has been designated a 'No Vehicle' zone.
Chappan Dukan has its own radio station, which was launched in 2022, catering to both shopkeepers and visitors. This marks the first instance of its kind in Madhya Pradesh, where 56 shops have their individual radio stations—a concept previously seen in malls of Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.
The Times of India reported in 2019 that the food shops at Chappan Dukan have reportedly contributed approximately 40% (estimated based on shopkeepers' statements) to the city's annual food market turnover of ₹5,000 crore.

Recognition
In September 2021, Chappan Dukan received an award from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for being a 'Clean Street Food' hub in Indore. It a FSSAI certified street food hub. In April 2022, Indore Smart City Development was awarded the First Prize for Chappan Dukan in the Built Environment category in the Smart Cities Conference held in Gujarat .

209,Muslihudin Čekrekčija Mosque,"Muslihudin Čekrekčija Mosque, also known as Čaršijska, is second oldest domed mosque in Sarajevo. It was constructed in 1526 in the Baščaršija area of the city, at the foot of Kovač (the center of the city's old trading center). It is raised in the mahala of Isa-Bey's turn. From the vakufnam (document bequeathing assets for religious, humanitarian, educational, or other purposes) of the founder of the mosque, Hajji Mustafa, the son of Ishak, is known to the people as Muslihudin Čekrekčija, her builder. This is also the oldest known original document written in Sarajevo.
In the vakufnam, in connection with the establishment and construction of the mosque, it is written:
""When a man dies, his work comes to an end, except for three things: the knowledge and skills he used, the good child who prays for him, and his enduring sadaqa [good deeds].""
– translation by Mehmed Handžić
Since 2004, the mosque has been under the protection of the Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was made by the Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments at the session held from 2 to 8 November 2004 with the following members: Zeynep Ahunbay, Amra Hadžimuhamedović (chair), Dubravko Lovrenović, Ljiljana Ševo and Tina Wik, who declared the mosque the National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today its links to its commercial past remain, as it is surrounded by shops.

210,Ferhat Pasha Mosque (Sarajevo),"Ferhadija Mosque (Bosnian: Ferhat-pašina džamija, Turkish: Ferhad Paşa Camii), also known as Ferhat Pasha Mosque, is a central building in the city of Sarajevo built by Bosnian Sanjak-bey (governor)  Ferhad-beg Vuković, a descendant of the famous mediaeval  Vuković family. This mosque has one dome above the prayer area and three small domes at the cloister and is one of the greatest achievements of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s 16th century Ottoman and Islamic architecture.
The Ferhadija mosque reflects the full maturity of the classical Ottoman style-domed mosque, portico with small domes, and beautiful built-on minaret.
Research works on the painted decoration inside the mosque carried out in 1964–1965 revealed five painted layers dating from various periods.
The oldest and extremely valuable decorations of the first layer date from the 16th century (in the dome, on the cornice and pendentives, the base of the corner calottes, the mihrab and the lunettes of the lower row of windows), belonging to the group known as Rumi ornament, which were also to be seen in the Aladža Mosque in Foča.
The next layers (on the calottes, central part of the mihrab, and surface of the dome) consists of purely floral decorations with the features of 18th-century style.
The third and fourth layers date from the late 19th century (1878), and the first quarter of the 20th.
The mosque was damaged during the Bosnian War in 1992–1995.

212,Gazi Husrev-begov bezistan,"Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan is one of the preserved bezistan in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Ottoman period in the history of the country. Built in 1555 in Baščaršija, bezistan still serves its purpose - trade.

History
Bezistan is part of the endowment of Gazi Husrev-beg. It was built in 1555 in the immediate vicinity of the Kuršumli Madrasa, the Bey's Mosque and the Clock Tower, with which it is connected by an eastern entrance. It is rectangular in shape with entrances, which border the 109 m long street in which small shops are located. Gazi Husrev-beg Street (also called Zlatarska) runs parallel along the bezistan. Dubrovnik craftsmen took part in the construction. Due to the slightly lower temperature achieved by building below the level of the surrounding streets, the original purpose of the bezistan was to trade in groceries. This still makes shopping on warm, summer days enjoyable. With its appearance, Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan is reminiscent of the Kapali Bazaar and bezistan in Istanbul or souk in the cities to the east.

National Monument
Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan has been declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was taken by the Commission to Preserve National Monuments at its session held from 4 to 11 September 2006, composed of: Zeynep Ahunbay, Amra Hadžimuhamedović (chair), Dubravko Lovrenović, Ljiljana Ševo and Tina Wik.
In addition to the bezistan, there was also the Tashlihan, which was built at the same time as the bezistan, also as the waqf of Gazi Husrev-beg. It suffered great damage in the fire of 1879, and the last walls of the Taslihan disappeared in 1912.

214,Tašlihan,"Tašlihan or Tašli han (transl. stone inn) is a former caravanserai that was located on the site of the current summer garden and an open bar of the Hotel Evropa in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the third stone caravanserai in Sarajevo, built in the period from 1540 to 1543, as an endowment of Gazi Husrev-beg, after his death. It was added to Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan on its western side. It was square in shape, and its length was 47 meters. It had a fountain in its yard, on the pillars of which was a small mosque. Upstairs were the passenger rooms. Domestic and foreign merchants had their shops within Tašlihan. It is believed that this caravanserai served for trade more than for passenger traffic. The fire of 1879 severely damaged Taslihan and made it unusable.

Archaeological site - remains of Tašlihan
As part of the project of rehabilitation, reconstruction and extension of the hotel ""Evropa"", from June 5 to July 13, 1998, archaeological excavations were carried out in the summer garden of the hotel, which resulted in the discovery of part of the foundations and massive walls of the inn.
Archaeological site - the remains of Tašlihan in Sarajevo were declared the National monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2007, by the Commission to preserve national monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

215,Sarajevo Clock Tower,"The Sarajevo Clock Tower (Bosnian: Sarajevska sahat-kula) is a clock tower in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located beside Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and is the tallest of the 21 clock towers erected throughout the country, reaching a height of 30 meters. The tower was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006.
The clock shows lunar time, in which the hands indicate 12 o'clock at the moment of sunset, the time of the Muslim Maghrib prayer. A caretaker sets the clock's time manually once a week.

History
The Sarajevo Clock Tower was constructed by Gazi Husrev-beg, a governor of the area during the Ottoman period. The earliest known documented mention of the tower dates to the 17th century in a work by Evliya Çelebi. It was rebuilt twice, once after fire damage when the city was attacked by Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1697, and again in 1762.
In 1874, the clock was replaced by a mechanism made by Gillett & Bland of London. The previous Turkish mechanism was moved to a mosque in the neighbourhood of Vratnik.
In 1967, the clock was repaired, and the hands and numbers on all four clock faces were gilt.
In 2006, the clock tower was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

216,Gazi Husrev-begov hamam,"The Bosniak Institute is an institution of culture and scholarship in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has a museum and a gallery, a cultural centre and a library, a publishing house and a cultural centre. The institute is the result of its founder, Adil Zulfikarpašić, a donor (waqf), businessman, politician and promotor of cultural and educational life in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With his wife Tatjana Zulfikarpašić, he collected and preserved cultural heritage and contemporary production about Bosnia and Herzegovina, ranging from documents, photographs, postcards, maps, to books, encyclopaedias, journals, and other archival and library materials. The Bosniak Institute was founded in Zurich in 1988, and after the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina the entire stock was moved to Sarajevo, and opened in 2001.
The Bosniak Institute includes a library, archive, art collection, galleries, reading rooms and researcher and scholar study rooms, conference rooms, and other amenities.

Gazi Husrev-bey's Hammam
The institute is situated in the centre of Sarajevo, at Mula Mustafe Bašeskije 21, adjacent to Gazi Husrev-begov hamam (Gazi Husrev-bey's Hammam), a public bath (hammam) built in 1535. Architects Hasan Ćemalović and Ahmet Kapidžić were awarded the Sixth of April Sarajevo Award in 2001 for the building, library, and a successful restoration of the Gazi Husrev-bey's Hammam. Two endowments (waqfs) are materialised in the Hammam building, first, Gazi Husrev-bey's, established when Islamic culture, education and scholarship were at their outset in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Bosniak Institute.

Library
The library of the Bosniak Institute has over 250,000 items (books, journals, maps, articles and other materials) ranging from the 14th century to contemporary scholarly and trade-specific resources of the 21st century. The library includes the following sections: Bosnica, Croatica, Serbica, Turcica, Islamica, Yugoslavica, manuscripts, reference works, as well as the collections such as Judaica, Bogomils, Sanjak, Emigrantica, and the 1992-1995 war section.

Art collection
The art collection of the Bosniak Institute evolved during several decades, originally as the private collection of Adil Zulfikarpašić and his wife Tatjana, and subsequently as the collection of the Bosniak Institute.
The collection includes more than 1500 artworks (paintings, engravings, and sculptures) by many Bosnian authors, from Ismet Mujezinović, Hakija Kulenović, Rizah Štetić, Ibrahim Ljubović, Vojo Dimitrijević, Mersad Berber, Affan Ramić, Mevludin Ekmečić, to Safet Zec, Salim Obralić, Mehmed Zaimović, and others. The donated private collections of Mersad Berber, Mevludin Ekmečić, Ismet Rizvić, Edo Numankadić and others are particularly significant.

Archive
The archive includes more than 8000 items ranging from the 15th century to the modern age.

218,Gazi Husrev-begov bezistan,"Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan is one of the preserved bezistan in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Ottoman period in the history of the country. Built in 1555 in Baščaršija, bezistan still serves its purpose - trade.

History
Bezistan is part of the endowment of Gazi Husrev-beg. It was built in 1555 in the immediate vicinity of the Kuršumli Madrasa, the Bey's Mosque and the Clock Tower, with which it is connected by an eastern entrance. It is rectangular in shape with entrances, which border the 109 m long street in which small shops are located. Gazi Husrev-beg Street (also called Zlatarska) runs parallel along the bezistan. Dubrovnik craftsmen took part in the construction. Due to the slightly lower temperature achieved by building below the level of the surrounding streets, the original purpose of the bezistan was to trade in groceries. This still makes shopping on warm, summer days enjoyable. With its appearance, Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan is reminiscent of the Kapali Bazaar and bezistan in Istanbul or souk in the cities to the east.

National Monument
Gazi Husrev-beg's bezistan has been declared a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was taken by the Commission to Preserve National Monuments at its session held from 4 to 11 September 2006, composed of: Zeynep Ahunbay, Amra Hadžimuhamedović (chair), Dubravko Lovrenović, Ljiljana Ševo and Tina Wik.
In addition to the bezistan, there was also the Tashlihan, which was built at the same time as the bezistan, also as the waqf of Gazi Husrev-beg. It suffered great damage in the fire of 1879, and the last walls of the Taslihan disappeared in 1912.

219,Gazi Husrev Bey's Library,"The Gazi-Husrev-beg Library is a public library in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina founded in 1537 by the Ottomans, and is part of a larger complex with Gazi Husrev-beg Medresa. It holds one of the most important collections of Islamic manuscripts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including many originally donated by Gazi Husrev-beg. The collection survived through Bosnian war and Siege of Sarajevo. The library also holds a sizable number of books, journals, newspapers, documents and photographs.
As part of the larger complex of Gazi Husrev-begova Medresa, the library facilities are part of the National Monument designation.

Foundation
In 1537, the Ottoman Empire governor of Bosnia, Gazi Husrev-beg, established a madrasa for the education of the people of the region. In the charter for its creation, the governor stipulated that ""whatever money remains from the construction of the madrasa shall be used for purchasing good books, which will be used in the madrasa by readers, and for copying from them by those who engage in science.""
The library and the madrasas functioned for over three hundred years as one unit until, in 1863, the library was moved to its own room, where it stayed until 1935 when it was moved to the Sarajevo Mufti’s office outside the Careva Mosque. The library continued to grow until the whole building of the former mufti's office was used for housing the library's holdings. It remained in this location until the start of the Siege of Sarajevo in 1992.

Destruction and safekeeping
In 1697, an Austrian general Eugene of Savoy, raided the library, destroying many historical works. Some of the most important documents to be lost were the Sarajevo court registers, chronicling land ownership, marriages, and other important legal events.
During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, much of the city of Sarajevo was under siege by forces of the Army of the Republika Srpska. Many of the printed books were moved to the Careva Mosque for safekeeping. The manuscripts were moved eight times during the nearly four-year siege of the city. The 500 most valuable manuscripts were placed inside the vaults of the Privredna Banka, where they were hidden. They remained there until the siege was lifted.

Rebuilding
The Gazi-Husrev-beg Library re-opened on January 15, 2014, after 10 years of construction. The new library was built largely from a grant of US$8.8 million from the country of Qatar and has the capacity to hold nearly 500,000 items. The new library is three stories high and made of glass and marble. It has reading rooms, a conservation room and a 200-seat auditorium with WiFi headsets that allows for simultaneous translations of up to three different languages. In the basement is a museum dedicated to Bosnia's history of literacy.

Holdings
The library contains over 100,000 volumes of manuscripts, printed books, and documents in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Bosnian and other languages. More than 10.500 library units include codices of manuscripts with approximately 20,000 texts in the fields of Islamic sciences, Oriental languages, belles-lettres, philosophy, logic, history, medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, astronomy, and others.
Since the Siege of Sarajevo and the restoration of the library, several important Islamic manuscripts have been added to the library's collection. Some of the most important of these manuscripts are the following:

The Ihya’ulum al-din is the oldest manuscript in the library and was written by Abu Hamid Muhammed al-Gazali (d. 1111) in Arabic.
The Diwan of Hafiz Shirazi (d. 1389), written in Persian, is illuminated with beautiful Islamic miniatures.
The Tuhfat al-ahrar is  a didactic poem written by the Persian writer Nur al-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami (d. 1486), and is one of the most representative pieces of Islamic calligraphy found in the collection. It was copied circa 1576.
*Firdaws al-akhbar bi-masur al-khitab is a hadith collection copied by ‘Abd al-Salam ibn Muhammad al-Khwarizmi in 1151 in Hamadan, Iran.
The third volume of the Qur’an commentary in Arabic, which covers the  Suras Six and Seven written by Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Talabi al-Nisaburi (d. 1035) and  copied by Barakat ibn ‘Isa ibn Abu Ya‘la Hamza in 1176.
Several illustrations from the encyclopaedic work Ma‘rifetname, written in Turkish by Sheikh Ibrahim Haqqi al-Erzurumi (d. 1780).
A portion of the Book Four of the al-Qanun, a famous work of medicine, written in Arabic by Ibn Sina (d. 1037).
An Arabic commentary on Ashkal al-ta’sis fi al-handasa, a geometric treatise by Musa ibn Muhammad Qadi-zada (d. 1412), which was copied in 1675.
The Arabic al-Mulakhkhas fi al-hay’a,  a manuscript on astronomy by Mahmud ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Umar al-Jagmini al-Khawarizmi (d. 1334). This particular work was copied in 1658.
There are also significant copies of Mus'hafs, illuminated copies of the Qur'an, contained in the library's collection as well as a variety of teaching licenses from the Ottoman Empire period, and 35,000 printed books in Bosnian and other European languages.

221,Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque,"Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (Bosnian: Gazi Husrev-begova džamija, Turkish: Gazi Hüsrev Bey Camii) is a mosque in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Built in the 16th century, it is the largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Having been Sarajevo's central mosque since the days of its construction, today it also serves as the main congregational mosque of the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the Baščaršija neighborhood in the Stari Grad municipality and, being one of the main architectural monuments in the town, is regularly visited by tourists.

History
The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque was built in 1530 as the central object of the Beg's endowment, which also included a maktab and a madrasa (Islamic primary and secondary schools), a bezistan (vaulted marketplace), a hammam (public bathplace) etc. The foundation of this waqf by the contemporary Ottoman governor of Bosnia had a crucial point in the development of the town. The architect's name is unknown, but after some speculations, which even included famous Mimar Sinan as an option, most scholars agreed that Acem Esir Ali ""Alaüddin"", an Ottoman mimar of Persian ancestry, is the most probable builder. It is still possible that Sinan himself did inspect the work on the spot, since he was in the region at the time. Historical documents testify that Ragusan masons, requested from their government by Gazi Husrev-beg, participated in the building process.
Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque was the first mosque in the world to receive electricity and electric illumination in 1898 during the period of Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Architecture
The mosque belongs to the type of complex-spaced, multi-domed mosques and it is a represent of the Early Period of Classical Ottoman Architecture (sometimes referred to as Early Istanbul Style). The central rectangular space, framed by high walls and covered with a dome resting on pendentives, represents the spine of the structure, while lower extensions lean to it and expand the volume of the interior space. The qibla side of the mosque is extended with a rectangular space which is covered by a semi-dome resting on two highly developed muqarnas structures. They stand in function of pendentives, reducing the rectangular outline of the ground level to the near semi-circle shape in level of the semi-dome. This area houses central architectural elements with religious purposes: mihrab, minbar and kursi and, being open to the central space with a huge arch, represents the focal point of the mosque. Two smaller spaces, called tetime (sg. tetima) are located on the left and right sides of the central space, placed furthest from the Kibla side. They are covered by two lower domes resting on pendentives.
The exterior is dominated by the main dome, topped out only by a simple, yet monumental minaret. The entry side is marked with a portico resting on four wide columns and covered with little domes, only the central one, above the portal, being a bit greater than others, and resting on muqarnas-adorned pendentives, in contrast to others which are laid on simple, plain-surfaced pendentives. The monumental portal is richly decorated with muqarnas, as well as columns' capitals.
In his legacy, he stated: ""Good deeds drive away evil, and one of the most worthy of good deeds is the act of charity, and the most worthy act of charity is one which lasts forever. Of all charitable deeds, the most beautiful is one that continually renews itself.""

Destruction and reconstruction
During the Siege of Sarajevo, Serbian forces purposely targeted many centers of the city's culture, such as museums, libraries, and mosques, and fired on them generally. As the largest and best known, the Beg's mosque was an obvious target.

Having suffered a significant amount of destruction, the reconstruction of the Mosque started with foreign - mainly Saudi - aid in 1996, right after the war. The old and faded layer of Austro-Hungarian decoration was removed and, since remains of older, historical layers of decorative painting weren't found, a completely new interior was designed and applied by Bosnian calligrapher Hazim Numanagić in 2001/2002. Austro-Hungarian decoration, performed mostly in pseudo-Moorish style, remains only on the portal of the Mosque today.

222,Gazi Husrev-beg's endowment,"Sultanzade Gazi Husrev-beg (Ottoman Turkish: غازى خسرو بك, Gāzī Ḫusrev Beğ; Modern Turkish: Gazi Hüsrev Bey; 1484–1541) was an Ottoman Bosnian sanjak-bey (governor) of the Sanjak of Bosnia in 1521–1525, 1526–1534, and 1536–1541. He was known for his successful conquests and campaigns to further Ottoman expansion into Croatia and Hungary. However, his most important legacy was major contribution to the improvement of the structural development of Sarajevo and its urban area. He ordered and financed construction of many important buildings there, and with his will bequeathed all his wealth into endowment for the construction and long-term support of religious and educational facilities and institutions, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque, and the Gazi Husrev-begova Medresa complex with a Gazi Husrev-beg Library, also known as Kuršumlija.

Biography
Origin
Gazi Husrev-beg was born in Serres,  Greece. His father, Ferhad-beg, was a Bosnian nobleman from Hum (modern-day Herzegovina), who worked as a high court official. His mother, Selçuk Sultan, was the daughter of the Sultan Bayezid II, making Gazi Husrev-beg Beyazid II's grandson.

Career
In less than three years, he conquered the fortresses of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica. He was appointed sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia on 15 September 1521, becoming one of Sultan Suleiman I's most trusted men.
A relentless campaign of conquest followed soon; the fortified towns of Greben, Sokol, Jezero, Vinac, Vrbaški Grad, Livač, Kamatin, Bočac, Udbina, Vrana, Modruč, and Požega fell at his hands.
He founded, among the many buildings he ordered to construct in the city, the vakuf of Sarajevo, which was active until the 20th century.
Gazi Husrev-beg played a crucial role to overcome the Christian army at the Battle of Mohács. His 10,000 Akıncıs and his irregular cavalry, composed of Turks, Bosnians and Crimean Tatars, served as reserve soldiers in that battle. According to the Ottoman military strategy, the Akıncıs circled the European knights while the Turkish infantry made a counterfeit retreat after the first assault.

Death
Gazi Husrev-beg's forces struggled against a power vacuum in Montenegro after the death of Ottoman ally, islamized Montenegrin lord Skender-beg Crnojević in 1528. In 1541, during an uprising of Montenegro nobility, he set out to protect the Crnojevićs and the local populace. After fighting many battles to maintain order in the region, although finally victorious, he was killed while fighting Christian rebels in Mokro, a small village in Drobnjaci (present-day Montenegro). Legend states that he was a big man, so his warriors were unable to carry him, but instead of doing this, they took apart his intestines and buried them on a small hill called Hodžina glavica (Imam's Peak). The legend has it that this event gave Drobnjaci their name (Drob is an archaic Serbo-Croatian word for intestines), although the name Drobnjaci is recorded earlier in history. However, its real connection to Gazi Husrev-beg's place of rest is unclear. His corpse was returned to Sarajevo, where it remains in a tomb in the courtyard of his mosque.

Endowment
Gazi Husrev-beg's endowment or Gazi Husrev-begov vakuf (trust or foundation) is based on his three vakufnama's (deeds of endowment), the first being issued November 1531, second on January 1537, and the third on November 1537. The three deeds of endowment were also legal basis for the establishment of the institution, the Gazi Husrev-begov Vakuf (or Gazi Husrev-beg's Endowment), whose primary purpose is to take care of the endowment's properties and support for the endowed established institutions. With it Husrev-beg bequeathed his property and wealth for the construction of facilities and the establishment of institutions, religious, educational, and public. The first vakufnama from 1531 required the construction of a mosque, humanitarian public kitchen (imaret) and guest house (musafirhana) and ḫāniqāh. The second issued on 1537 required for the Kuršumlija madrasa to be established and built, and also library to be equipped with books and other publications books purchased. The third from 1537 endowed additional property to support the mosque and other facilities.
The endowment today consists of a number of buildings and institutions built and supported by the Gazi Husrev-begov Vakuf: the Gazi Husrev-bey's Mosque, built in 1531 as the central object of the religious part of the endowment with a clock tower, Husrev-beg's and his turbe's and other supporting buildings, Gazi Husrev-bey's Madrasa with the Gazi Husrev-bey's Library as the central objects of the educational part of the endowment, Gazi Husrev-bey's bezistan, Morića Han as konak and Tašli Han as a caravanserai, Gazi Husrev-bey's Hamam, imaret and musafirhana near clock tower, muvekkithane, šadrvan, hastahana as a hospital, mekteb, Gazi Husrev-begov Hanikah as a Dervish's monastery with a boarding school, and large number of shops around the Baščaršija.
The Museum of Gazi Husrev Beg is established in fall 2012 by the Gazi Husrev Beg Waqf (endowment).
Most of these building are declared National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Commission to preserve national monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

225,Morića Han,"Morića Han is a han (a roadside inn) originally built in 1551 in Sarajevo, Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). After a fire in 1697 it was reconstructed in its current form. Morića Han is one of the buildings which were financed by and belonged to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment (Vakuf). It is the only surviving han in Sarajevo. It is located in Baščaršija, Sarači street, in Stari Grad.
Morića Han (also spelled ""khan"" when translated to English) is considered a true caravanserai because, when operational, it could accommodate about 300 passengers and 70 horses. Evliya Çelebi, an Ottoman traveller, wrote about his visit to Sarajevo in 1659 and described Morića Han as Hadži-Bešir's han, because Hadži-Bešir was landlord of the han then. The modern name probably comes from the surname of the han's tenants at the beginning of the 19th century, Mustafa-aga Morić and his son Ibrahim-aga Morić. However, some sources connect the name of this han with the Morić brothers who participated in rebellions against the Ottoman Empire from 1747 to 1757.
The citizens of Sarajevo gathered in Morića Han on 29 July 1878, established Narodni Odbor (English: Peoples Council) and protested against the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary.

The han has survived several fires, most recently in December 1957 when the entire building was destroyed. It was reconstructed from 1971 to 1974 and decorated with Persian calligraphy inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayyám. Stari Grad returned ownership of Morića Han to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment in 1998. Management of the endowment rents the han for business purposes that match the historical context, including a national restaurant, a Persian carpet shop, and religious societies.
Morića Han is mentioned in the sevdalinka song ""Vila kliče sa vrh Trebevića"" used in the film When Father Was Away on Business, directed by Emir Kusturica.

227,Sarajevo Clock Tower,"The Sarajevo Clock Tower (Bosnian: Sarajevska sahat-kula) is a clock tower in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located beside Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and is the tallest of the 21 clock towers erected throughout the country, reaching a height of 30 meters. The tower was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2006.
The clock shows lunar time, in which the hands indicate 12 o'clock at the moment of sunset, the time of the Muslim Maghrib prayer. A caretaker sets the clock's time manually once a week.

History
The Sarajevo Clock Tower was constructed by Gazi Husrev-beg, a governor of the area during the Ottoman period. The earliest known documented mention of the tower dates to the 17th century in a work by Evliya Çelebi. It was rebuilt twice, once after fire damage when the city was attacked by Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1697, and again in 1762.
In 1874, the clock was replaced by a mechanism made by Gillett & Bland of London. The previous Turkish mechanism was moved to a mosque in the neighbourhood of Vratnik.
In 1967, the clock was repaired, and the hands and numbers on all four clock faces were gilt.
In 2006, the clock tower was declared a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

228,Baščaršija,"Baščaršija (Cyrillic: Башчаршија; pronounced [baʃ.tʃǎr.ʃi.ja]) is Sarajevo's old bazaar and the historical and cultural center of the city. Baščaršija was built in the 15th century when Isa-Beg Ishaković founded the city.
Baščaršija is located on the north bank of the river Miljacka, in the municipality of Stari Grad. On Baščaršija there are several important historic buildings, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and sahat-kula. Today Baščaršija is the major tourist attraction of Sarajevo.

Etymology
The word Baščaršija derives from the Turkish language. The word ""baš"" which is ""baş"" in Turkish literally means ""head"", but in some contexts also means ""primary"", ""main"", ""capital"". ""Čaršija"" which is ""çarşı"" in Turkish means ""bazaar"" or ""market"".
Although the suffix 'ja' (modern Turkish: '(y)a') means 'to' in Turkish, implying that the full name of the district literally translates to 'to the main bazaar', it is more likely that the ending -ija is a Bosnianism, as many Turkish loanwords have the same ending to conform to Bosnian grammatical rules. In the nominative case, the place has always been referred to in Turkish as ""Başçarşı"" only, without ""ya"".

History
Before the arrival of the Ottomans in the largest settlement on Sarajevo field was the village square Tornik, which was located at the crossroad of the roads where today is the Ali Pasha's Mosque. Baščaršija was built in 1462 when Isa-Beg Isaković built the Ishaković han, in addition to its many shops.
Around the main entrance, the Bazerdžani čaršija was formed. The čaršija Kazaz is situated to the west, and to the north sit both the čaršija Sedlar and Sarača. The most significant buildings constructed during this period were mosques. Baščaršija's famous mosque was built by Havedža Durak in 1528, and Gazi Husrev-beg built his mosque in 1530.
Gazi Husrev-beg built a Gazi Husrev-begova Medresa, a library, a haniqah, the Gazi Husrev-beg Hamam, the Gazi Husrev-beg bezistan, the Morića Han, sahat-kula and other tourist attractions in Baščaršija. Gazi Husrev-Beg was buried in the harem of his mosque, beside the harem is the türbe of his freed slave and the first mutevelija of his vakuf, Murat-beg Tardić.
Along with Islamic places of worship erected at that time, Baščaršija is also the location of the Old Orthodox Church, built sometime during the 16th century and first mentioned in Ottoman sources from 1539, and also the first Sephardic Jewish temple the Old Synagogue, built between 1581 and 1587. Just next to the Old Synagogue (Bosnian: Stari Hram = Old Temple) the New Synagogue (Bosnian: Novi Hram = New Temple) was built a short time after.
Today the Jewish community uses the more recently erected synagogue just across the Miljacka river, while both Old and New synagogue buildings are used as Jewish cultural centers. The New Synagogue was donated by the Jewish community to the city of Sarajevo and serves as a gallery called Novi Hram. The Old Synagogue building was turned into the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered to be one of the finest exhibition spaces in the former Yugoslavia.

During the 16th century a number of commercial facilities was built, such as bezistans, hans, and caravanserais. Sarajevo was an important center of trade in the Balkans and had three bezistans (today the Gazi Husrev-begov bezistan and Brusa bezistan are still standing). There were colonies of Venetian and Ragusan traders, and Baščaršija had approximately 12,000 commercial and craft shops. 
After the earthquake in 1640 and several fires in 1644 and 1656, Sarajevo was burned and devastated by the troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1697. Travel writer Evliya Çelebi wrote:

""The čaršija has in everything, one thousand and eighty stores that are a model of beauty. The čaršija is very attractive and built according to plan.""
The city of Sarajevo didn't expand significantly until the 19th century. With the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878, foreign architects wanted to rebuild Sarajevo into a modern European city. A fire contributed to this process, destroying parts of the Stari Grad.
With the liberation of Sarajevo in 1945 after the Second World War, a committee decided that the market should be gradually demolished, believing that it had no role in a modern city. However, the plans were cancelled, and the buildings were left standing.

229,Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque,"Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (Bosnian: Gazi Husrev-begova džamija, Turkish: Gazi Hüsrev Bey Camii) is a mosque in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Built in the 16th century, it is the largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Having been Sarajevo's central mosque since the days of its construction, today it also serves as the main congregational mosque of the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the Baščaršija neighborhood in the Stari Grad municipality and, being one of the main architectural monuments in the town, is regularly visited by tourists.

History
The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque was built in 1530 as the central object of the Beg's endowment, which also included a maktab and a madrasa (Islamic primary and secondary schools), a bezistan (vaulted marketplace), a hammam (public bathplace) etc. The foundation of this waqf by the contemporary Ottoman governor of Bosnia had a crucial point in the development of the town. The architect's name is unknown, but after some speculations, which even included famous Mimar Sinan as an option, most scholars agreed that Acem Esir Ali ""Alaüddin"", an Ottoman mimar of Persian ancestry, is the most probable builder. It is still possible that Sinan himself did inspect the work on the spot, since he was in the region at the time. Historical documents testify that Ragusan masons, requested from their government by Gazi Husrev-beg, participated in the building process.
Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque was the first mosque in the world to receive electricity and electric illumination in 1898 during the period of Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Architecture
The mosque belongs to the type of complex-spaced, multi-domed mosques and it is a represent of the Early Period of Classical Ottoman Architecture (sometimes referred to as Early Istanbul Style). The central rectangular space, framed by high walls and covered with a dome resting on pendentives, represents the spine of the structure, while lower extensions lean to it and expand the volume of the interior space. The qibla side of the mosque is extended with a rectangular space which is covered by a semi-dome resting on two highly developed muqarnas structures. They stand in function of pendentives, reducing the rectangular outline of the ground level to the near semi-circle shape in level of the semi-dome. This area houses central architectural elements with religious purposes: mihrab, minbar and kursi and, being open to the central space with a huge arch, represents the focal point of the mosque. Two smaller spaces, called tetime (sg. tetima) are located on the left and right sides of the central space, placed furthest from the Kibla side. They are covered by two lower domes resting on pendentives.
The exterior is dominated by the main dome, topped out only by a simple, yet monumental minaret. The entry side is marked with a portico resting on four wide columns and covered with little domes, only the central one, above the portal, being a bit greater than others, and resting on muqarnas-adorned pendentives, in contrast to others which are laid on simple, plain-surfaced pendentives. The monumental portal is richly decorated with muqarnas, as well as columns' capitals.
In his legacy, he stated: ""Good deeds drive away evil, and one of the most worthy of good deeds is the act of charity, and the most worthy act of charity is one which lasts forever. Of all charitable deeds, the most beautiful is one that continually renews itself.""

Destruction and reconstruction
During the Siege of Sarajevo, Serbian forces purposely targeted many centers of the city's culture, such as museums, libraries, and mosques, and fired on them generally. As the largest and best known, the Beg's mosque was an obvious target.

Having suffered a significant amount of destruction, the reconstruction of the Mosque started with foreign - mainly Saudi - aid in 1996, right after the war. The old and faded layer of Austro-Hungarian decoration was removed and, since remains of older, historical layers of decorative painting weren't found, a completely new interior was designed and applied by Bosnian calligrapher Hazim Numanagić in 2001/2002. Austro-Hungarian decoration, performed mostly in pseudo-Moorish style, remains only on the portal of the Mosque today.

230,Morića Han,"Morića Han is a han (a roadside inn) originally built in 1551 in Sarajevo, Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). After a fire in 1697 it was reconstructed in its current form. Morića Han is one of the buildings which were financed by and belonged to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment (Vakuf). It is the only surviving han in Sarajevo. It is located in Baščaršija, Sarači street, in Stari Grad.
Morića Han (also spelled ""khan"" when translated to English) is considered a true caravanserai because, when operational, it could accommodate about 300 passengers and 70 horses. Evliya Çelebi, an Ottoman traveller, wrote about his visit to Sarajevo in 1659 and described Morića Han as Hadži-Bešir's han, because Hadži-Bešir was landlord of the han then. The modern name probably comes from the surname of the han's tenants at the beginning of the 19th century, Mustafa-aga Morić and his son Ibrahim-aga Morić. However, some sources connect the name of this han with the Morić brothers who participated in rebellions against the Ottoman Empire from 1747 to 1757.
The citizens of Sarajevo gathered in Morića Han on 29 July 1878, established Narodni Odbor (English: Peoples Council) and protested against the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary.

The han has survived several fires, most recently in December 1957 when the entire building was destroyed. It was reconstructed from 1971 to 1974 and decorated with Persian calligraphy inscriptions from poems written by Omar Khayyám. Stari Grad returned ownership of Morića Han to Gazi Husrev-Beg's endowment in 1998. Management of the endowment rents the han for business purposes that match the historical context, including a national restaurant, a Persian carpet shop, and religious societies.
Morića Han is mentioned in the sevdalinka song ""Vila kliče sa vrh Trebevića"" used in the film When Father Was Away on Business, directed by Emir Kusturica.

235,Palika Bazaar,"Palika Bazaar,  is an underground market located between the inner and outer circle of Connaught Place, Delhi, India. It is named after Palika Bazaar of Mumbai. Palika Bazaar hosts 380 numbered shops selling a diverse range of items; however, the market is dominated by electronic items and clothing. Palika Bazaar was set up in 1979,but since the 1990s it has seen a decline in customers. 
Palika Bazaar is estimated to have some 15,000 people within its confines at any given time and also attracts many foreign tourists. It is known for its reasonably priced items and is a famous tourist attraction. It also has a reputation for a wide availability of illegal products such as pornography, stolen goods, fake designer products and unlicensed CDs, software and movies. Police conduct regular raids to recover stolen or counterfeit merchandise, but this has failed to put an end to the illegal activity in the market.
It has been listed as a notorious market since 2009 by the USTR for being an underground market with large amounts of counterfeit products including pirated software and media.

Security Problems
After the rape of a female shopper by two shopkeepers in April 2007, Delhi Police advised women against entering Palika Bazar alone. Local media reported that female visitors often complain about eveteasing and harassment, and a lack of proper trial rooms.

""Regeneration"" Project
As part of a wider effort, the New Delhi Municipal Council is currently working on plans for a major ""regeneration of Palika Bazaar"", described to be in a state of decay.

237,Bazaari,"Bazaari (Persian: بازاری) is the merchant class and workers of bazaars, the traditional marketplaces of Iran. Bazaari are involved in ""petty trade of a traditional, or nearly traditional, kind, centered on the bazaar and its Islamic culture"". They have been described as ""the class of people who helped make the 1979 Iranian Revolution"".
A broader, more recent definition includes traditional merchants outside of Iran, ""a social class...in places where the society is in the midst of an awkward modernization; where the bazaar is in some stage of transition between the world of A Thousand and One Nights and that of the suburban shopping mall"", an example being traditional merchants (also Muslim) who back the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. However, it has also been noted that merchants in other Middle Eastern countries are predominantly minority non-Muslim populations without the political influence of bazaari in Iran.
Bazaari differ from a social class as usually defined, in that they include both ""rich wholesalers and bankers"" as well as lower-income workers. They are united not in their relation to the means of production but ""in their resistance to dependence on the West and the spread of Western ways"", their ""traditionalist attitude"", and their ""close family, financial, and cultural ties"" with the Shia ulama, or clerical class.
Bazaari, ""led by its large merchants"", in alliance with ulama clergy ""or important parts of the clergy"", have played an important part in recent Iranian history. The alliance was ""central"" to the successful Tobacco Protest against a British monopoly tobacco concession of 1891–92, to the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–11, and especially to the 1979 overthrow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Bazaari supported victims of the anti-Shah struggles in 1978 and their families, as well as providing ""financial support for the antiregime strikes that began in May 1978 among university students and teachers and in the fall [of 1978] spread to the workers and civil servants"".
The bazaari continue to underpin the ruling elite today, one example being Noor Foundation Director Mohsen Rafighdoost, whose wealth has been described by American journalist Robert D. Kaplan as likely to amount to ""tens or hundreds of millions of dollars"".

238,Chorsu Bazaar,"Chorsu Bazaar  (Persian: بازار چارسو, Uzbek: Chorsu bozori), also called Charsu Bazaar, is the traditional bazaar located in the center of the old town of Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan. Under its blue-colored domed building and the adjacent areas, all daily necessities are sold.

Overview

239,Seventh-Kilometer Market,"The Seventh-Kilometer Market (Ukrainian: Ринок «Сьомий кілометр», Rynok Siomyi Kilometr) is an outdoor market outside of Odesa, Ukraine.

Description
Originally, in the 1960s and 1970s, it was open only on Sundays (later on Saturdays) in Slobidka, near the 3rd Jewish cemetery on Khimichna Street, at the time a small walled-in area of 150 m wide and 250 m long, hence totally inadequate for a market and where an association with shoving originated.  The new version was founded in 1989 during Perestroika reforms; it is now possibly the largest market in Europe.
When founded as an Odesa flea market in the 1960s, the market was officially restricted to selling used items only, but entry was charged to anyone entering with anything held in their hands because new items would be sold by traders from their hands (з рук) walking the market as opposed to used goods sold off the ground displays. The market was open until 3–4 pm, but owing to the difficulty in reaching it, which until 1966 involved a 2 km walk from the nearest tram (No. 15) stop; it was paramount to reach the market very early in the morning as all worthwhile goods were sold by 10–11 am.
When relocated in 1989, it was to an area outside the city's limits at the seventh kilometer of the Odesa–Ovidiopol highway, thus acquiring its name. As of 2006, the market covered 170 acres (0.69 km2) and consists largely of steel shipping containers, which rent for up to US$6,000 (EUR 4,700) or more per month, as well as an increasing number of ordinary shops in buildings. It has roughly 6,000 traders and an estimated 150,000 customers per day. Daily sales, according to the Ukrainian periodical Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, were believed to be as high as US$20 million in 2004. With a staff of 1,200 (mostly guards and janitors), the market is also the region's largest employer. It is owned by local land and agriculture tycoon Viktor Dobrianskyi and three partners of his.
The independent traders on the market sell goods in all price ranges, from authentic merchandise to all sorts of cheap Asian consumer goods, including many counterfeit Western luxury goods. According to the impressions of S. L. Myers of The New York Times who visited the market in 2006,

""the market is part third-world bazaar, part post-Soviet Walmart, a place of unadulterated and largely unregulated capitalism where certain questions — about salaries, rents, taxes or last names — are generally met with suspicion.""
Dzerkalo Tyzhnia wrote in 2004 that

""it is a state within a state, with its own laws and rules. It has become a sinecure for the rich and a trade haven for the poor.""
However, Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko announced in 2005 that he intended to enforce tax laws on the market's thriving shadow economy.

240,Central Market (Casablanca),"The Central Market (Arabic: السوق المركزي, French: Marché Central) in Casablanca, Morocco is a marketplace with historical and cultural significance. It is located on Muhammad V Boulevard, among the colonial architecture of the 20th century, facing the Central Market Tramway Station.

History
The Central Market was designed by Pierre Bousquet, and construction was completed in 1917, on the site of the Casablanca Fair of 1915.
The Central Market was the most important marketplace in Casablanca's European ville nouvelle.
The Moroccan nationalist resistance fighter Muhammad Zarqtuni bombed the Central Market on December 24, 1953, after French forces forced Sultan Muhammad VI into exile on August 20, 1953—which was Eid al-Adha.

Architecture
The market is characterized by its Neo-Mauresque architectural style. Among its most prominent features is its large gateway, imitating styles of gates in Morocco's imperial cities: Marrakesh, Fes, Rabat, and Meknes.
Another feature of the market is the octagonal center cupola, under which different kinds of fresh seafood are sold, such as Atlantic Ocean fish, shark meat, oysters, etc. The daily catch is displayed around a circular walkway and on a central island where oysters from Dakhla are shucked on the spot for one-by-one consumption.
Flowers are also sold in decorated bouquets and handicrafts such as woven reed baskets. Fossils and antiques, such as old black-and-white photographs and posters, are also available.
Produce, herbs, spices, and meat from butcher shops are also sold.
The market also houses some restaurants and is considered one of the most important lunch destinations for tourists and Casawis alike.

Access
The Central Market Station on Line 1 of the Casablanca Tramway is directly in front of the Central Market's main entrance on Muhammad V Street.

241,Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar,"The Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar, also known as Pang Jai (棚仔), is a covered market located at the intersection of Yen Chow Street and Lai Chi Kok Road in Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong. The market is known for selling fabrics, textiles, and other fashion-related paraphernalia. The market has been popular with craft enthusiasts, design students, and professionals in the fashion industry for decades.

History
The market was established in 1978, after construction on the Tsuen Wan line for the MTR forced the market to move to its current location on Yen Chow Street. At one point, over 200 sellers were selling their merchandise in the market.

Closure
In 1981, the government decided to repurpose the site for residential use. The issue of the rezoning was discussed by the Sham Shui Po District Council in 2005. In August 2016, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department issued a notice to the tenants of the market that the government intended to close the site to make way for a public housing development. The government proposed that the current licensed tenants be moved to the Tung Chau Street Temporary Market.  Alternatively, the government would buy back the licence from the licence holders for HK$80,000, well below the usual market price of HK$120,000.
On September 28, 2016, the cloth vendor received a letter from the FEHD notifying the arrangement and details of the relocation of the ""shack"", requesting the cloth vendor to reply in mid-October to accept (a letter of commitment), otherwise the stall will be withdrawn. At the same time, the letter does not recognize the identities of 17 of them as operators (there were 50 operators in the shed at that time), and all relocation and compensation arrangements do not apply to these 17 people. Part of the reason for not recognizing the identity of the operator is that there will only be one registrant for a ""husband and wife file"". However, among the 33 people who were recognized as operators, some couples were recognized at the same time. The hawker complained to the FEHD. The FEHD required the hawker to provide proof that he was the operator, but there was no public identification criteria. Some hawkers took out electricity bills, sales receipts and other documents, all of which were accused of being unable to prove their identity its identity. The Shed Tsai Concern Group issued a statement saying that the FEHD's identification process lacked objective criteria and was not transparent, and demanded that the FEHD collectively acknowledge it and firmly refused to differentiate.

242,Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk,"The International Festival of Arts ""Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk"", also known as Slavic Bazaar, is an annual festival held in Vitebsk, Belarus under the auspices of the Belarusian Government since 1992. Its main program is devoted to Slavic music. The main participants are artists from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, countries of the former Yugoslavia, Poland, and Bulgaria with guests from many other countries, both Slavic and non-Slavic.

History
The predecessor of the festival was ""Polish Song Festival in Vitebsk"" (Polish: pl:Festiwal Piosenki Polskiej w Witebsku) that was held in Vitebsk.  Vitebsk was chosen to host the festival according to the agreements with Polish city Zielona Góra where ""Soviet Song Festival"" (Polish: Festiwal Piosenki Radzieckiej) was held since 1965. The main venue of the present-day festival, the Amphitheatre, was constructed especially for such occasion in 1988.
Only two editions of the ""Polish Song Festival in Vitebsk"" were held: in 1988 and 1990. After the Dissolution of the Soviet Union the cultural ties between the former Soviet bloc countries have broken. So there emerged an idea to organize a cultural arrangement in order to show the cultural diversity of Slavic nations. The first Slavianski Bazaar was opened on 18 July 1992. It was organized by the Belarusian Government with the financial support from Russia and Ukraine. The main goal of the very first festival was an attempt to acquaint the Belarusian audience with pop and folk trends from Slavic countries.
In 1993 the festival became a member of the International Federation of Festival Organizations (FIDOF). 
The festival was awarded the diploma 'FIDOF Festival of the Year 2000' ""for impeccable quality of organization, professionalism, hospitality, and promotion of noble humanistic aims on the international level"".

The contest
During the festival, a contest for young singers is held. It has two stages, each held on a separate day. On the first day the contestants should perform the song in a national language of the country the contestant represents. All vocals are sung live using backing track. On the second day the contestants perform the song written by a composer from any Slavic country in any of the Slavic languages. On this stage all vocals must be sung live with the National Concert Orchestra of Belarus under Mikhail Finberg's conduction.

Children's contest winners
The children's contest during the festival in Vitebsk was first held in 2003, an expansion of the cultural and artistic diversity of the event. It has become one of the mainstay events in the Eurasian Region ( North Asia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia) for child performers making their way to Junior Eurovision Song Contest.

245,Braderie de Lille,"The Lille Braderie (French: Braderie de Lille) is a braderie, or annual street market/flea market, that takes place on the weekend of the first Sunday of September in Lille, France, in the northern Hauts-de-France region. It dates back to the 12th century, attracting nearly three million visitors each year. The Braderie de Lille is one of the largest gatherings in France and the largest flea market in Europe. In 2014 the Braderie was reported to host 100km of market stalls to over 10,000 exhibitors.
During the Braderie, the city hosts a music festival. The traditional food eaten during the festival, moules-frites, typically results in built-up heaps of mussel shells around the city.

In 2016, the Braderie was cancelled by Lille mayor Martine Aubry, following terrorist incidents in France.

246,Suli An,"The Suli An (Macedonian: Сули ан, Albanian: Hani i Sulit, Turkish: Sulu Han) is a han in the Old Bazaar of Skopje, North Macedonia. It was built in the mid-15th century by Isa-Beg Isaković.

Etymology
The name of the han is derived from the Turkish Sulu Han, with su which meaning water, and the word sulu meaning ""with water"". This name was probably chosen because a small river used to run near the han.

Characteristics
The total area of the han is around 2,100m². During the Ottoman Empire, the Suli An was a classic city han for travelers and traders with their caravans.
The Suli An was damaged in the 1963 Skopje earthquake but was reconstructed in 1972.
Today, the building houses the Skopje Faculty of Arts and the Museum of the Old Bazaar of Skopje.

247,Urdu Bazaar,"The Urdu Bazaar (literally, 'Urdu market') is a major market in the walled city of Delhi, India that connected the canal in the middle of Chandni Chowk to Jama Masjid. The original market was destroyed in the aftermath of Indian Rebellion of 1857, but its name survives as a location near the Jama Masjid.
The Urdu language obtained its name from this market.
Ghalib lamented on the destruction of Delhi in the aftermath of the failure of the 1857 rebellion: ""My dear man, when Urdu Bazaar is no more, where is Urdu? By God, Delhi is no more a city, but a camp, a cantonment. No Fort, no city, no bazaars, ...""
Delhi's first Chief Executive Councillor and noted freedom fighter, Mir Mushtaq Ahmad, was a resident here prior to and during his term in office and founded the Janata Cooperative Bank in Urdu Bazaar in 1956 for the benefit of local businesses and residents. His premises also hosted periodic meetings of nationally reputed poets and intellectuals.
Today, the main book publishing, printing and selling markets of the Pakistani cities such as Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi are also known as Urdu Bazaar.

248,Dordoy Bazaar,"Dordoy Bazaar (Kyrgyz: Дордой Базары, Dordoj Bazary, Russian: Рынок Дордой; also spelled Dordoi Bazaar in English) is a large wholesale and retail market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The largest bazaar in Kyrgyzstan, it is one of Asia's greatest public marketplaces, comparable to Bangkok's Chatuchak Weekend Market or Tehran's Grand Bazaar.
Dordoy Bazaar is a major shopping and employment centre for the Bishkek metropolitan area and entire Chuy River Valley region. It is also one of the main entrepôts through which consumer goods from China arrive at shops and markets in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. According to some economists, this re-export (the other center for which, targeting Uzbekistan, is the Karasuu Bazar at Kara-Suu, Osh Region) is one of two largest economic activities of Kyrgyzstan.

Location and organization
The Dordoy market stretches for more than a kilometre on the north-eastern outskirts of Bishkek, near the bypass highway that skirts the city in the north. Legally, it is an agglomeration of several independent markets adjacent to each other. Since there are no fences, the borders between the markets are not particularly noticeable. According to a 2007 city atlas, the component markets are:

Ak-Suu
Vostok ('East')
Sever ('North')
Muras-Sport
Alkanov i K ('Alkanov & Co.')
Evropa ('Europe')
Kerben
Kitay ('China')
Zhonghai (which formally is considered a separate market from Dordoy)
Most of the market is built of double-stacked shipping containers. Typically, the lower container is a shop, while the upper one provides storage. According to a 2005 newspaper report, there were 6,000 to 7,000 containers in the bazaar. As of March 2024, approximately 70,000 people work officially and unofficially in connection to Dordoy.
The containers, organized in dozens of rows, form streets and plazas of a sort covering the equivalent of 160 rugby fields. Smaller buildings between the blocks of containers house restaurants, administrative offices, toilets, hotels, and other ancillary structures.

History
The market is said to date from 1992, its 15th anniversary being celebrated in 2007.
In the view of journalists from the neighbouring Uzbekistan, one of the causes for the rise of Bishkek's Dordoy Bazaar was the decline of Uzbekistan's major wholesale markets. After the Uzbek government transferred Tashkent's huge Hippodrome Market to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior in 1998, increased police harassment of the trader resulted in Hippodrome losing its dominant position in the region. After its reconstruction in 2002–2003, Hippodrome, which once had 8,600 trading outlets and 18,000 traders, was succeeded by the much smaller Chilanzar goods market with 2,540 outlets. A similar story took place in Jizzakh, where in 2006 authorities closed the Dunyo Bozori (Uzbek for ""World Market"") marketplace (which had been established by Chinese traders) to replace it with the Abu Sahiy Nur shopping centre. As Uzbekistan's markets declined, purchasing by Uzbek buyers has shifted to Kyrgyzstan's Bishkek or Kara-Suu.

Ownership and management
Most of the marketplace (Dordoy proper, i.e. everything but Zhonghai) is run by OsOO ""Dordoy Bazari"" (Kyrgyz: ОсОО ""Дордой базары""), a member of the 
""group of companies"" called Dordoi Association. The Zhonghai section is run by Dordoi Asia, another member of the same group.
Besides the Dordoy markets, Dordoi Association also owns the smaller Alamedi Market, closer to central Bishkek (via OsOO ""Alamudun Bazari"" (Kyrgyz: ОсОО  «Аламудун базары»)), Dordoi Plaza shopping mall in downtown Bishkek, a number of manufacturing and service companies in Bishkek and elsewhere, a beach resort at Koshkol' on Lake Issyk Kul, and the soccer team Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn.

The traders
Different sections of the markets specialize in various types of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, furniture, electric and electronic equipment, toys, automotive supplies, construction materials, etc. While some kinds of groceries (e.g. factory-packaged canned goods or sweets) are sold at Dordoy, it is not a produce market. Occasional produce vendors are present merely to feed the vendors and customers.
Most of the goods sold at Dordoy arrive from China, with the second largest source (perhaps 30% of all imports) being Turkey. One can also find clothing from Thailand and Europe, music CDs from Russia, and goods from many other countries in Eurasia, as well as a selection of local products.
Although many of the people working and shopping at the Bazaar speak Kyrgyz, Russian is the main language used in trade.

Transportation
There is no rail access to the market: all goods enter and depart the bazaar by truck or car.
Two large plazas near the northern and southern ends of the market are connected by frequent minibus service with central Bishkek. From the northern plaza, minibuses also run to various points throughout Chüy Region, including Sokuluk, Kant, Tokmok, and Korday border crossing (on the Kazakhstan border). For the convenience of the ""shuttle traders"", charter buses run from Dordoy to several major cities in Kazakhstan and in Russia's Urals and Western Siberia.

It is located in the area between Grand Bazaar and Eminönü in the Mahmutpaşa neighbourhood of Fatih district. This market area, with copious small shops on both sides of the main street, is a symbol of cheap shopping in Istanbul. The bazaar hosts 256 shops.

History
The bazaar gets its name from the street, named after the nearby Mahmut Pasha Mosque: this was commissioned by the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha (d. 1474) during the rule of Sultan Mehmed II in 1462.  The mosque complex also contains a hamam, a türbe, sebils and fountains.

251,Souq,"A bazaar (Persian: بازار, romanized: bâzâr; Ottoman Turkish: پازار, romanized: pazar; Uzbek: bozor; Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār) or souk (Arabic: سوق, romanized: sūq; also transliterated as souq or suq) is a marketplace consisting of multiple small stalls or shops, especially in the Middle East, the Balkans, North Africa and South Asia. However, temporary open markets elsewhere, such as in the West, might also designate themselves as bazaars. The ones in the Middle East were traditionally located in vaulted or covered streets that had doors on each end and served as a city's central marketplace. Street markets are the European and North American equivalents.
The term bazaar originates from Persian, where it referred to a town's public market district. The term bazaar is sometimes also used to refer collectively to the merchants, bankers and craftsmen who work in that area. The term souk comes from Arabic and refers to marketplaces in the Middle East and North Africa.
Although the lack of archaeological evidence has limited detailed studies of the evolution of bazaars, the earliest evidence for the existence of bazaars or souks dates to around 3000 BCE. Cities in the ancient Middle East appear to have contained commercial districts. Later, in the historic Islamic world, bazaars typically shared in common certain institutions, such as the position of the muḥtasib, and certain architectural forms, such as roofed streets and courtyard buildings known in English as caravanserais. The exact details of their evolution and organization varied from region to region.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Western interest in oriental culture led to the publication of many books about daily life in Middle Eastern countries. Souks, bazaars and the trappings of trade feature prominently in paintings and engravings, works of fiction and travel writing.
Shopping at a bazaar or market-place remains a central feature of daily life in many Middle-Eastern and South Asian cities and towns and the bazaar remains the beating heart of West Asian and South Asian life; in the Middle East, souks tend to be found in a city's old quarter. Bazaars and souks are often important tourist attractions. A number of bazaar districts have been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their historical and/or architectural significance.

Terminology by region
Bazaar
In general, a souk is synonymous with a bazaar or marketplace. The term souk is used in Arabic-speaking countries.
The origin of the word bazaar comes from New Persian bāzār, from Middle Persian wāzār, from Old Persian wāčar, from Proto-Indo-Iranian *wahā-čarana. The term spread from Persian into Arabic and ultimately throughout the Middle East.
The term bazaar is a common word in the Indian subcontinent: Hindi: बाज़ार, romanized: bāzār; Punjabi: ਬਜ਼ਾਰ।, romanized: bazāra; Bengali: বাজার, romanized: bājār; Nepali: बजार, romanized: bajār; Urdu: بازار, romanized: bazār.

Differing meanings of ""bazaar""
In North America, the United Kingdom and some other European countries, the term charity bazaar can be used as a synonym for a ""rummage sale"" to describe charity fundraising events held by churches or other community organizations in which either donated used goods (such as books, clothes and household items) or new and handcrafted (or home-baked) goods are sold for low prices, as at a church or other organization's Christmas bazaar, for example.
Although Turkey offers many famous markets known as ""bazaars"" in English, the Turkish word ""pazar"" refers to an outdoor market held at regular intervals, not a permanent structure containing shops. English place names usually translate ""çarşı"" (shopping district in a downtown or downtown itself) as ""bazaar"" when they refer to an area with covered streets or passages. For example, the Turkish name for the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is ""Kapalıçarşı"" (gated shopping area), while the Spice Bazaar is the ""Mısır Çarşısı"" (Egyptian shopping area).
In Czech, the word bazar means second-hand shop. Autobazar is a shop that purchases and sells pre-owned cars.

Variations
In Indonesian, the word pasar means ""market"". The capital of Bali province, in Indonesia, is Denpasar, which means ""north market"".

Souk
The Arabic word is a loan from Aramaic ""šūqā"" (""street, market""), itself a loanword from the Akkadian ""sūqu"" (""street""). The spelling souk entered European languages likely through French during the French occupation of the Arab countries Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, the word ""souk"" mostly refers to Arabic and North African traditional markets. Other spellings of this word involving the letter ""Q"" (sooq, souq, and so'oq) were likely developed using English and thus refer to Western Asian or Arab traditional markets, as there were several British colonies there during the 19th and 20th centuries.
In Modern Standard Arabic the term al-sooq refers to markets in both the physical sense and the abstract economic sense (e.g., an Arabic-speaker would speak of the sooq in the old city as well as the sooq for oil, and would call the concept of the free market السوق الحرّ as-sūq al-ḥurr).

Variations on ""souk""
In northern Morocco, the Spanish corruption socco is often used as in the Grand Socco and Petit Socco of Tangiers.
In the Indian subcontinent the 'chowk' is often used to name a place with four-way crossroad, and comes from Sanskrit चतवार, meaning four. In Western Asia (the Middle East), this term is generally used to designate the market, but may also be used in Western cities, particularly those with a Muslim community.

In Israel, the term shuk or shuq (Hebrew: שׁוּק, romanized: šūq) shares a common Aramaic origin of the Arabic souk, and holds a prominent role in everyday life. Markets such as Mahane Yehuda in Jerusalem are often covered rows of stalls much like those seen elsewhere in the region, selling produce, spices, halvah, and even clothing.
In Malta, the terms suq and sometimes monti are used for a marketplace.
In the United States, especially in Southern California and Nevada, an indoor swap meet is a type of bazaar, i.e. a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed ""booths"" or counters for the vendors.

History
Origins in antiquity
Scholar Mohammad Gharipour has pointed out that in spite of the centrality of souks and bazaars in Middle Eastern history, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. Historical records document the concept of a bazaar existing in Iran as early as 3000 BCE, where some large cities contained districts dedicated to trade and commerce. Archeological data also suggests the existence of market districts in ancient Mesopotamia. Markets centers must have existed in Egypt to conduct international trade, but no archeological evidence for them has been found. In Achaemenid Persia (550–330 BCE), documents indicate that crafts were sold in markets close to Persepolis. A network of bazaars had sprung up alongside ancient caravan trade routes. Bazaars located along these trade routes, formed networks, linking major cities with each other and in which goods, culture, people and information could be exchanged. Sources from around the same era also indicate that ancient Greeks regulated trade in areas at the center of their cities around stoa buildings. The ideas of Greek city planning were spread to the Middle East during the Seleucid period, following the conquests of Alexander the Great.
The Greek historian, Herodotus, noted that in Egypt, roles were reversed compared with other cultures and Egyptian women frequented the market and carried on trade, while the men remain at home weaving cloth. He also described The Babylonian Marriage Market.
Sassanid rule in Iran was an important period for the development of urbanization and commerce. In Sassanid Iran the bazaar was usually the heart of a town or city, where it spread outwards and affected the development of other neighbourhoods. The bazaar usually contained, or was adjoined by, an open-air plaza that served as a forum of socio-economic activity.
Historically, souks were also held outside cities at locations where incoming caravans stopped and merchants displayed their goods for sale. Souks were established at caravanserai, places where a caravan or caravans arrived and remained for rest and refreshments. Since this might be infrequent, souks often extended beyond buying and selling goods to include major festivals involving various cultural and social activities. Any souk may serve a social function as being a place for people to meet in, in addition to its commercial function.
In pre-Islamic Arabia, two types of bazaar existed: permanent urban markets and temporary seasonal markets. The temporary seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce. Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle East in the history of bazaars, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence. However, documentary sources point to permanent marketplaces in cities from as early as 550 BCE.

Islamic period
According to traditional Muslim narratives, Muhammad established a market place (sūq) in Medina shortly after arriving there during the Hijrah in 622 CE. He designated an open, unbuilt space as the market area and forbade both the construction of permanent structures and the levying of taxes in this area. Eight years later, he is said to have appointed a market inspector ('āmil 'alā l-sūq), a position that likely evolved into the later muḥtasib in Islamic cities, an official in charge of overseeing public morality and regulating weights and measures. 
Despite the importance of the bazaar to economic life and the prominence of marketplace terminology in the Quran, not much is known about the early history of bazaars and it remains a topic of ongoing research. Most of the surviving urban commercial structures in the Islamic world date from the 16th century or later, though some preserved urban caravanserais (commonly known as a funduq, khān, or wakāla) date from earlier periods. The oldest of these is the Khan al-Mirjan in Baghdad, built in 1359 as part of a larger architectural complex.

Muhammad's prohibition against constructing permanent buildings and levying taxes in the market began to be disregarded as early as the Umayyad period (7th to 8th centuries). The Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik both built structures in the market of Medina and levied taxes there, while purpose-built markets were built in early Islamic cities further abroad such as Basra in Iraq, Fustat in Egypt, and Kairouan in Tunisia. This process seems to have accelerated during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) in particular. Markets that sold the most important or expensive goods were usually located near the city's central Friday mosque. In some cities, such as Cairo and Aleppo, the main bazaar was initially focused along one important street and then progressively grew and branched off into the surrounding streets.

During the Islamic period in Iran, bazaars developed along the same lines as those of the Sassanid period. Up to the 11th century, the bazaar developed more commonly in the suburbs outside the city walls that enclosed the shahristān, the formal city. This was especially true in Central Asia, though there were exceptions in some regions where the bazaar was grouped with the citadel and the city's Friday mosque inside the city walls. After the 11th century, the growing importance of the suburbs and the commercial districts resulted in most of them being enclosed within newly expanded city walls. From the 10th century onward, the bazaar became the financial center of a city and was heavily patronized and developed by ruling elites. The grouping of a bazaar, citadel, and Friday mosque also became more common.
In the Mamluk Sultanate (13th to 16th centuries) and in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries), the construction of commercial buildings in and around the bazaar was often sponsored by sultans, ruling elites, or by members of the Ottoman royal family. The revenues generated by these buildings were typically earmarked to support the upkeep of religious complexes sponsored by these same patrons, through the legal framework of a waqf (legal endowment).

21st century
In the Middle East, the bazaar is considered to be ""the beating heart of the city and a symbol of Islamic architecture and culture of high significance."" Today, bazaars are popular sites for tourists and some of these ancient bazaars have been listed as world heritage sites or national monuments on the basis of their historical, cultural or architectural value.
The Medina of Fez, Morocco, which includes numerous long market streets (e.g. Tala'a Kebira) and bazaar areas (e.g. Kissariat al-Kifah), was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Al-Madina Souk in Aleppo is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. It is part of the Ancient Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986 in Syria. The Bazaar complex in Tabriz, Iran, was listed by UNESCO in 2010. The Bazaar of Qaisiyariye in Lar, Iran, is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2007. Kemeraltı Bazaar in İzmir was placed on tentative list in 2020.

Organization and institutions
Shopping at a souk or market place is part of daily life throughout much of the Middle East. Prices are commonly set by bargaining, also known as haggling, between buyers and sellers.
Bazaars or souks are traditionally divided into specialized sections dealing in specific types of product, each usually housed in a few narrow streets and named after the product it specializes in such as the gold souk, the texitle souk, the spice souk, the leather souk, the booksellers' souk, etc. This promotes competition among sellers and helps buyers easily compare prices. Merchants specialized in each trade were also organized into guilds, which provided support to merchants but also to clients. The exact details of the organizations varied from region to region.  Each guild had rules that members were expected to follow, but they were loose enough to allow for competition. Guilds also fulfilled some functions similar to trade unions and were able to negotiate with the government on behalf of merchants or represent their interests when needed.
Though each neighbourhood within the city would have a local souk selling food and other essentials, the main bazaar was one of the central structures of a large city, selling durable goods, luxuries and providing services such as money exchange. Workshops where goods for sale are produced (in the case of a merchant selling locally-made products) are typically located away from the souk itself. 
Historically, in Islamic cities, the muḥtasib was the official in charge of regulating and policing the bazaar and other aspects of urban life. They monitored things such as weights and measures, pricing, cleanliness, noise, and traffic circulation, as well as being responsible for other issues of public morality. They also investigated complaints about cheating or the quality of goods. The equivalent official could be known by other titles in different regions, such as the kedkhoda in Istanbul or the amir-i bazariyan in Delhi. In the Maghreb (northwestern Africa), the muḥtasib also shared responsibilities with other officials such as the qadi or the hakim.

Layout and architecture
Permanent bazaars were established in urban zones, usually within the city walls and close to the heart of the city. In much of the Middle East and North Africa, the bazaar is a network of interconnected spaces, including streets and buildings, with diverse architectural forms. Its boundaries are not sharply defined and can vary according to circumstance, as the bazaar is closely integrated with its urban surroundings and with other important institutions of the city.
Although there is great variety among the bazaars of this region, there are three recurring elements, in addition to the general network of market streets. One element is the individual shops or booths that line each side of a market street. The shops are usually small spaces open to the street and occupied by merchants. They are typically equipped with large shutters which can be closed and locked when the shopkeeper is away. Another element is a more secure market area, usually centrally located and consisting of streets that were covered or roofed. This complex is variably known as a qayṣariyya, bedesten, or khān, depending on the city or historical period. It usually hosted the most prestigious and profitable trades such as jewelry, perfumes, and textiles. In order to protect these goods, the entrances to this area could be closed and locked at night or in times of danger. The other recurring element is the presence of courtyard buildings entered via a single large doorway. Often translated into English as a caravanserai, this type of building is known in different regions as a funduq, khān, samsara, or wakāla. They could serve a variety of functions including an inn for travelers and merchants, a manufacturing center, a trade venue, or a warehouse.

In Iran and Central Asia, the permanent bazaar is likewise in the centre of a city and had common architectural elements. These bazaars acted as financial centers of the city and were traditionally overseen by the state. Some Iranian bazaars are organized around one long market street from which other market streets branch off (e.g. in Isfahan or Tehran), while others are large rectangular zones with a grid-like network of parallel and intersecting streets (e.g. as in Tabriz). The streets are lined with structures of one or two storeys that contain spaces for shops. The streets are typically roofed with brick vaults, pierced by skylights to allow for light and air circulation. The shops are often adjacent or connected to the workshops where the goods are also produced, so that manufacturing and retail are often concentrated in the same areas, though some production (especially of textiles) was also distributed in other parts of the city. Like the bazaars further west, there were also many khāns (caravanserais) built in the area. They acted as warehouses, production centers, wholesale centers, hostels for merchants, and offices for conducting business. 

In the cities that developed under the Ottoman Empire, there was generally one central bazaar area, known in Turkish as the çarşı. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, known locally as the Kapalıçarşı ('covered market'), is a famous example. Additionally, several types of market structures were common: the bedesten, the arasta, and the han (Turkish cognate of khān). The Ottoman bedesten was a solid stone building, typically rectangular and roofed by domes, with shops inside. Like the qayṣariyya or bedesten in other regions, it hosted the most important and luxurious trades. The arasta is usually an elongated market structure or market street with shops lining its façades. Arastas could be independent markets built outside the main bazaar area, such as those built as part of large religious complexes like the Selimiye Mosque complex in Edirne or the Sultanahmet Mosque complex in Istanbul. The Spice Bazaar or Mısır Çarşısı ('Egyptian Market') in Istanbul is also one of the largest and best-known examples. The han is similar in function to other khān or caravanserai buildings elsewhere, with a courtyard enclosed by two storeys. The ground floor was usually used for storage and for stabling horses, while the upper floor housed merchants.

Temporary souks
A temporary, seasonal souk is held at a set time that might be yearly, monthly or weekly. The oldest souks were set up annually, and were typically general festivals held outside cities. For example, Souk Ukadh was held yearly in pre-Islamic times in an area between Mecca and Ta’if during the sacred month of Dhu al-Qi'dah.  While a busy market, it was more famous for its poetry competitions, judged by prominent poets such as Al-Khansa and Al-Nabigha. An example of an Islamic annual souk is Al Mirbid just outside Basra, also famed for its poetry competitions in addition to its storytelling activities. Temporary souks tended to become known for specific types of produce. For example, Suq Hijr in Bahrain was noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. Political, economic and social changes have left only the small seasonal souks outside villages and small towns, primarily selling livestock and agricultural products.
Weekly markets have continued to function throughout the Arab world. Most of them are named from the day of the week on which they are held. They usually have open spaces specifically designated for their use inside cities. Examples of surviving markets are the Wednesday Market in Amman that specializes in the sale of used products, the Ghazl market held every Friday in Baghdad specializing in pets; the Fina’ Market in Marrakech offers performance acts such as singing, music, acrobats and circus activities.
In tribal areas, where seasonal souks operated, neutrality from tribal conflicts was usually declared for the period of operation of a souk to permit the unhampered exchange of surplus goods. Some of the seasonal markets were held at specific times of the year and became associated with particular types of produce such as Suq Hijr in Bahrain, noted for its dates while Suq 'Adan was known for its spices and perfumes. In spite of the centrality of the Middle Eastern market place, relatively little is known due to the lack of archaeological evidence.

In art and literature – Orientalism
During the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans conquered and excavated parts of North Africa and the Levant. These regions now make up what is called the Middle East, but in the past were known as the Orient. Europeans sharply divided peoples into two broad groups – the European West and the East or Orient; us and the other. Europeans often saw Orientals as the opposite of Western civilization; the peoples could be threatening- they were ""despotic, static and irrational whereas Europe was viewed as democratic, dynamic and rational."" At the same time, the Orient was seen as exotic, mysterious, a place of fables and beauty. This fascination with the other gave rise to a genre of painting known as Orientalism. A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.

Subject-matter
Many of these works were lavishly illustrated with engravings of every day scenes of Oriental lifestyles, including scenes of market places and market trade. Artists focused on the exotic beauty of the land – the markets, caravans and snake charmers. Islamic architecture also became favorite subject matter. Some of these works were propaganda designed to justify European imperialism in the East, however many artists relied heavily on their everyday experiences for inspiration in their artworks. For example, Charles D'Oyly, who was born in India, published the Antiquities of Dacca featuring a series of 15 engraved plates of Dacca [now Dhaka, Bangladesh] featuring scenes of markets, commerce, buildings and streetscapes. European society generally frowned on nude painting – but harems, concubines and slave markets, presented as quasi-documentary works, satisfied European desires for pornographic art. The Oriental female wearing a veil was a particularly tempting subject because she was hidden from view, adding to her mysterious allure.

Notable Orientalist artists
Notable artists in the Orientalist genre include: Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830-1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853-1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910) who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce. French painter Jean-Étienne Liotard visited Istanbul in the 17th century and painted pastels of Turkish domestic scenes. British painter John Frederick Lewis who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life. Edwin Lord Weeks was a notable American example of a 19th-century artist and author in the Orientalism genre. His parents were wealthy tea and spice merchants who were able to fund his travels and interest in painting. In 1895 Weeks wrote and illustrated a book of travels titled From the Black Sea through Persia and India. Other notable painters in the Orientalist genre who included scenes of street life and market-based trade in their work are Jean-Léon Gérôme Delacroix (1824–1904), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (1803–1860), Frederic Leighton (1830–1896), Eugène Alexis Girardet 1853–1907 and William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), who all found inspiration in Oriental street scenes, trading and commerce.

Orientalist literature
A proliferation of both Oriental fiction and travel writing occurred during the early modern period.
Many English visitors to the Orient wrote narratives around their travels. British Romantic literature in the Orientalism tradition has its origins in the early eighteenth century, with the first translations of The Arabian Nights (translated into English from the French in 1705–08). The popularity of this work inspired authors to develop a new genre, the Oriental tale. Samuel Johnson's History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, (1759) is mid-century example of the genre. Byron's Oriental Tales, is another example of the Romantic Orientalism genre.
Although these works were purportedly non-fiction, they were notoriously unreliable. Many of these accounts provided detailed descriptions of market places, trading and commerce. Examples of travel writing include: Les Mysteres de L'Egypte Devoiles by Olympe Audouard published in 1865 and Jacques Majorelle's Road Trip Diary of a Painter in the Atlas and the Anti-Atlas published in 1922

252,Souk Kriaa,"Souk Kriaa (Arabic : سوق قريعة) or The New Souk that is also known as Souk El Msakkaf is one of the markets of the medina of Sfax.

Localization
It is located outside of the northern medina's fences right in front of Bab Jebli. It is principally home to fabric shops, household machines and butchers.

History
The souk was designed by the French architect Bernard Zehrfuss, it was opened in 1952. In 2000, it got classified as a national historical monument by the National Institute of Heritage.
The souk carries the last name of the contractor and the main builder Mohamed Kriaa.

Architecture
Souk Kriaa is a covered space with an irregular pentagon shape, with four domed wings and a huge entrance that contains a huge dome. It surrounds Souk El Hout from all four sides.
After the World War II, due to the immense lack of building materials (like iron and cement etc.), Mohammed Kriaa preferred using local materials to build the souk. That's how it was built using the traditional way with local stones and lime. As for the roof, the domes and barrels were made using clay bricks, depending on huge arcs that are a little bit cracked.

All these details emphasize the view and the aesthetic integration of the souk in its environment, to the point that it is still considered as an extension to the medina of Sfax. This building is well integrated in its environment and it is a component that can not be ignored in the urban scene of the center of Sfax.

277,Souk al-Safafeer,"Souk al-Safafeer (Arabic: سوق الصفافير) is an ancient souk or bazaar in Baghdad, Iraq, that branches off al-Rasheed Street and connects to al-Mustansiriya Madrasa. The souk was established in Central Baghdad on the shores of the Tigris River in the Abbasid period and has been active ever since. Traditionally, the souk's craftsmen are specialized in creating handmade copperwork for household or decorative uses using hammers and hand tools. The souk is notable for the large amount of hammer-beating sounds that echoed throughout the market. Despite the significant role the souk plays, the souk has been suffering greatly after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Etymology
Souk al-Safafeer was named after the Arabic word for the yellowish tint of copper.

Description
General layout
The current market is said to date back to between 1600 and 1618 during the Ottoman period and is located on the western side of al-Rasheed Street. Located near the Tigris River, the souk is 500 meters wide and contains many handmade copperwork. These copperwork items, which include plates and shapes, are contained inside many shops owned by the coppersmiths. 
The number of shops in the market was estimated to be 200. The market does not accept any foreign material to sell. Instead, all the copperwork in the market is done by the coppersmiths by hand. Traditionally, many of the coppersmiths and craftsmen are relatives of previous coppersmiths who worked in the same markets over many generations and who have inherited the profession. The workers of the markets who inherited the profession have also inherited their characteristics. Which include ""precision, patience, deliberation, and taste.""

Mosque
Souk al-Safafeer contains an old archaeological mosque, called al-Safareen Mosque. Its area is approximately 250 square meters, and it contains a small prayer space that can accommodate more than 40 worshipers. This mosque was built by a philanthropist during the time of the Ottoman Empire, specifically in the middle of the 18th century.

Present day
Under former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, a law was established that every building or establishment in Iraq that dates back a hundred years is considered a heritage site and should be preserved. Among the sites that were on the list were al-Maiden Square, al-Rasheed Street and Souk al-Safafeer. However, this law was abolished after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the Iraq War, many US coalition troops bought a lot of the items in the market which left barely any remaining antiques and copperwork. This was also the same period in which many of the workers fled the country, leaving it empty. Many fake Iraqi antiques have also started to materialize in the market.
Since the US invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath Party in 2003, the souk has been declining and suffering from government neglect and a lack of customers and tourists visiting it. Before the invasion, the market included 68 coppersmiths but as of 2018, only 10 of them remained. Demand for copper materials declined as the average Iraqi salary, which is currently 400 dinars per month, declined. As such, customers didn't have enough money to buy copper items from the market. Furthermore, many of the coppersmith shops, estimated to be 90% of the souk, were turned into fabric stalls which added to the decline of the heritage and traditional role of the souk. 
Many of the shops have been sold or rented by the original shop owners. There was also the issue of shop owners who imported cheap Chinese materials in order to make a quick profit. The biggest issue that the market faces has been cited by the remaining coppersmiths to be government neglect and lack of support from state officials.

278,Gold Market,"The Gold Market (Arabic: سوق الذهب Souk ad-Dahab; also known as the Qissariya Market, Arabic: سوق القيسارية Souk al-Qissariya) is a narrow covered passageway located in the old quarter of Gaza, Palestine; it is both a center for trading and buying gold, and location for foreign exchange.  The Market lies along the southern edge of the Great Mosque of Gaza, beside the main Omar Mukhtar Street.  The Market is configured with a pointed and vaulted roof above the central road, which is lined on both sides by small shops that are themselves roofed by the cross vaults of the covered central road.

History
Gazan judge Sheikh Shams ad-Din al-Himsi ordered the construction of the Gold Market in 1476 CE, under Mamluk rule in Palestine.  The Market originally formed a part of a much larger covered market, but most of the area was destroyed by the British Army during World War I.
Throughout most of the 20th and 21st centuries, the market was visited mostly by men and women engaged to be married, to pick out gold jewellery, and by mothers-in-law to purchase gifts for their daughters-in-law.  However, because of food shortages arising in Gaza from the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, the Gold Market presently is used chiefly by elderly Gazans selling family heirlooms to raise cash.

It is situated east of the al-Hukm Palace compound in the Qasr al-Hukm District and is one of the oldest marketplaces in the city that specialize in carpets trading and the sale of agarwoods. Covering an area of almost 9.5 acres, the souq's origins date as far back as 1901. Its name is derived from zulliya (Arabic: زولية, romanized: zūlīya), the Gulf Arabic word for floor rug and was located in close proximity to the erstwhile Dakhna quarter.
The Royal Commission for Riyadh City had completed the renovation project for the souq in 2005. Souq al-Zal was selected as one of the 15 entertainment zones by the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia during the 2022 edition of Riyadh Season.

283,Jemaa el-Fnaa,"Jemaa el-Fnaa (Arabic: ساحة جامع الفناء Sāḥat Jāmiʾ al-Fanāʾ, also Jemaa el-Fna, Djema el-Fna or Djemaa el-Fnaa) is a square and market place in Marrakesh's medina quarter (old city). It remains the main square of Marrakesh, used by locals and tourists.

Name
The origin of its name is unclear: jamaa means ""congregation"" or ""mosque"" in Arabic, probably referring to a destroyed mosque on the site. Fnaʼ or fanâʼ can mean ""death/extinction"" or ""a courtyard, space in front of a building"". ""finâʼ in Arabic commonly means ""open area""; a straight translation would be ""the gathering/congregation area"". Other meanings could be ""The assembly of death,"" or ""The Mosque at the End of the World"". Another explanation is that it refers to a mosque with a distinctive courtyard or square in front of it. A third translation is ""assembly of the dead"", referring to public executions on the plaza around 1050 CE.

One specific explanation endorsed by modern historians comes from historical reports that the powerful Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur (ruled 1578–1603) had embarked on the construction of a monumental Friday mosque in the middle of the square. However, due to a downturn in fortunes (probably outbreaks of the plague) the sultan was forced to abandon the project part-way through. The mosque thus remained unfinished and fell into ruins. The ruined outline of its walls was apparently still visible in the 19th century and corresponded roughly to the current site of the ""Souk Jdid"" (the ""new souk"" just north of the food-stalls). In this way, ""jamaa al-fna' "" ostensibly refers to the place of the ""ruined mosque"". The name ""Jamaa al-Fna' "" appears in historical records for the first time in the 17th-century chronicle of the West African historian Abderrahman as-Sa'idi. As-Sa'idi claimed that the intended name of al-Mansur's unfinished mosque was jamaa al-hna, meaning ""Mosque of Tranquility"", but that after its abandonment it came to be known, by popular irony, as the ""Mosque of ruination/annihilation"", or jamaa al-fana' (the word fana' in this case meaning a state of being extinguished or totally ruined).

History
Early history: Almoravid and Almohad periods
Marrakesh was founded by the Almoravid dynasty in 1070 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar and subsequently developed by his successors.: 63  Initially, the city's two main monuments and focal points were the fortress known as Ksar el-Hajjar (""fortress of stone"") and the city's first Friday mosque (the site of the future Ben Youssef Mosque). The Ksar el-Hajjar was located directly north of today's Kutubiyya Mosque. The major souk (market) streets of the city thus developed along the roads linking these two important sites and still correspond to the main axis of souks today. At one end of this axis, next to the Ksar el-Hajjar, a large open space existed for temporary and weekly markets. This space was initially known as Rahbat al-Ksar (""the place of the fortress""). Other historical records refer to it as as-Saha al-Kubra (""the grand square""), or simply as as-Saha or ar-Rahba.
The Almoravid emir Ali ibn Yusuf (ruled 1106–1143) soon afterwards constructed a palace directly south of and adjacent to the Ksar el-Hajjar, on the actual site of the later Kutubiyya Mosque. One part of this palace was a monumental stone gate on its east side which faced towards the Rahbat al-Ksar. The gate likely played a symbolic role: it was the entrance to the palace for those seeking an audience with the sovereign, and it's possible the ruler himself would sit, enthroned, before the gate and publicly dispense justice on a weekly basis (a tradition which existed among other Moroccan and Andalusian ruling dynasties). The importance of the great public square in front of the royal palace thus led it to become the place for public executions, military parades, festivals, and other public events until long afterwards.
After a destructive struggle, Marrakech fell to the Almohads in 1147, who undertook many construction projects throughout the city. This included construction of the nearby Kutubiyya Mosque, begun in 1147, which was meant to replace the Almoravid-built Ben Youssef Mosque as the city's main mosque. Notably, a new royal kasbah (citadel) was erected further south by Ya'qub al-Mansur after 1184. As the Almohad rulers moved to the new kasbah, the old Almoravid palace and fortress fell out of use and was eventually torn down (in part to make way for the new Kutubiyya Mosque). Subsequently, with the fortunes of the city, the Jemaa el-Fna saw periods of decline and also renewal.

Later history: Saadian period to modern times
Despite the encroachment of new constructions on the edge of the square over time, it never disappeared due to its role as an open market area and as the site of public events. One attempt to fill a large part of the square is reported to have been made by the Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur who attempted to build a monumental mosque in the square. The mosque would have likely followed the same model as the Bab Doukkala and Mouassine Mosques, being deliberately built in the midst of major traffic routes in the city, and would have been accompanied by a number of attendant civic and religious buildings. The mosque was never finished, however, possibly due to disasters like the plague epidemics during al-Mansur's reign. Construction was abandoned part-way through and what had been built fell into ruin and was taken over by market stalls and other occupants. (It is probably also the site of a modern shop complex, Souk Jdid, just north of the food-stalls today, whose outline has the same compass orientation as the mosques of al-Mansur's time.) This ruined mosque may have given the square its current name, Jemaa el-Fna (""Mosque of Ruins"").
On January 24, 1864, a massive explosion took place in the area of the square, reportedly caused by the criminal negligence of certain officials trying to avoid a government inspection. A fire in a funduq (commercial warehouse) ignited 500 quintals of gunpowder which were dangerously stored there. The explosion damaged houses and shops in a wide radius and resulted in some 300 deaths.: 535 
The square continued to serve as a meeting place at the heart of the city despite having no formal architectural delineation. In addition to its old role as a place of public executions, it was also the site of a traditional Friday market, a stage for the performance of fantasias, and the setting of public entertainment in the evenings (much as today). In 1922 the government (under French administration at the time), passed the first laws aimed at protecting and preserving the square's cultural space and heritage. In 2001 the square was proclaimed an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO, and in 2008 it was included in UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

The Square
During the day it is predominantly occupied by orange juice stalls, water sellers with traditional leather water-bags and brass cups, youths with chained Barbary apes and snake charmers despite the protected status of these species under Moroccan law.
As the day progresses, the entertainment on offer changes: the snake charmers depart, and late in the day the square becomes more crowded, with Chleuh dancing-boys (it would be against custom for girls to provide such entertainment), story-tellers (telling their tales in Berber or Arabic, to an audience of locals), magicians, and peddlers of traditional medicines. As darkness falls, the square fills with dozens of food-stalls as the number of people on the square peaks.

The square is edged along one side by the Marrakesh souk, a traditional North African market catering both for the common daily needs of the locals, and for the tourist trade. On other sides are hotels and gardens and café terraces, and narrow streets lead into the alleys of the medina quarter.
The square fulfills an important function for storytellers and helps keep Amazigh/Berber culture alive, and those cultural expressions have drawn worldwide attention. German filmmaker Thomas Ladenburger made a 90-minute documentary on the storytellers, and its importance for tourism received academic attention as well.

UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity
The idea of the UNESCO project Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity came from people concerned about the Jamaa el Fna. The place is known for its active concentration of traditional activities by storytellers, musicians and performers, but it was threatened by economic development pressures. In fighting for the protection of traditions, the residents called for action on an international level to recognize the need for the protection of such places — termed ""cultural spaces"" — and other popular and traditional forms of cultural expression.
UNESCO encourages communities to identify, document, protect, promote and revitalize such heritage. The UNESCO label aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity.

The spectacle of Jamaa el Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes — voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches. The oral tradition is framed by one much vaster — that we can call intangible. The Square, as a physical space, shelters a rich oral and intangible tradition.

2011 bombing
Shortly before noon on April 28, 2011, a blast originating in a café in the square killed 17 people and injured another 25. Initial reports blamed an accidental gas explosion, but officials later blamed ""criminals"" and ""terrorists"".

2023 Earthquake
An earthquake with a 6.8 magnitude that struck Morocco in the evening of Friday the 8th of September 2023 highly damaged the Kharbouch Mosque and collapsed its minaret, which overlooked the square. In the days after the earthquake, local residents took to sleeping outside in the square to avoid the potential impact of aftershocks causing more buildings to collapse.

Trivia
Jamaa El-Fnaa, Marrakesh's main square, was featured in the fifth episode of the 25th Season of The Amazing Race.

284,Al-Madina Souq,"Al-Madina Souq (Arabic: سوق المدينة, romanized: Sūq al-Madīna) is the covered souq-market located at the heart of the Syrian city of Aleppo within the walled ancient part of the city. With its long and narrow alleys, al-Madina Souq is the largest covered historic market in the world, with an approximate length of 13 kilometers. It is a major trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India and many other products. Al-Madina Souq is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) scattered within the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (قيساريات). Caeserias are smaller than khans in size and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their function and location in the souq, and are characterized by beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors.
Al-Madina Souq is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986.
Many sections of the souq and other medieval buildings in the ancient city were destroyed, ruined or burnt as a result of fighting between the Syrian opposition and the Syrian Armed Forces beginning on 25 September 2012.

Souqs and khans
The city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south.
The most significant souqs within and along the covered area of Souq al-Madina:

Khan al-Qadi, one of the oldest khans in Aleppo dating back 1450.
Khan al-Burghul (or bulgur), built in 1472, hosted the British general consulate of Aleppo until the beginning of the 20th century.

285,Kissariat al-Kifah,"The Kissariat al-Kifah (Arabic: قيسارية الكفاح) or Kissaria (القيسارية) is the historic central bazaar of Fes el-Bali, the historic old city of Fez, Morocco. It is located between the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II and the Qarawiyyin Mosque.

History
The bazaar has been established here since the early Idrisid period of the city (9th-10th centuries). However, its streets and houses were rebuilt at least once after the double devastation of a fire in 1324 and a flood in 1325. Since the 15th century, the bazaar was situated inside what the Muslims of the city considered the horm (sacred sanctuary) of the nearby Zawiya of Moulay Idris II. Accordingly, non-Muslims and animals were traditionally not allowed to enter this area – at least in theory, and especially during times of religious tension.: 374 
After another fire in modern times, probably in 1918, the former wooden roof was replaced with a flat roofing made of reeds, similar to that found in some other North African cities of the time.: 315  Roger Le Tourneau, a French historian who published a history of pre-colonial Fez in 1949, noted that the shops of the Kissaria had a slightly more luxurious appearance than those of other market streets in the city, with their wooden shutters sometimes carved with decorative lines or their ceilings sometimes painted.: 317 

Further renovations in the 20th century replaced the reed roofs with flat concrete roofs. The most recent renovations, in 2016 and 2017, replaced the street roofs with new wooden roofs, made various repairs and practical improvements, and added tile decoration along the lower walls.
	Appearance of the Kissaria over time

Layout and function

The Kissaria (a term also used in other parts of the Islamic world and also transliterated from Arabic as qaysariyya) is interconnected with the Souq al-'Attarin and consists of a close network of lanes and alleys which are filled with hundreds of shops. It is only one part of a larger commercial district and of a network of souqs (markets) across the city, but was traditionally the most prestigious and most central commercial complex, where the most luxurious goods were sold.  This arrangement of a planned bazaar at heart of the city, near its most important religious and civic monuments, was typical of many major cities in the Islamic world.
Unlike most markets in historic Fes, the Kissaria consists of a grid-like network of streets roughly parallel or perpendicular to each other, completely filled with shops and without any residential structures. It is delimited to the north by the Souq al-'Attarin, to the east by the street bordering the Qarawiyyin Mosque, to the west by the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II, and to the south by the Souq al-Shamma'in.: 374  A number of funduqs (merchant inns and warehouses) are also found nearby, such as the Funduq al-Shamma'in.
Traditionally, different streets or sections of streets in the bazaar were specialized for different products, such as clothes, silks, babouches (traditional slippers), and jewelry. Some goods were sold by auctions that took place at specific times of the day.: 374  Historically, every entrance to the Kissaria was also equipped with doors that were shut and locked at night to protect the merchandise inside. Only the porters (zerzaya) were allowed to remain here overnight in order to patrol the streets.: 374

293,Souk El Bchemkya,"Souk El Bchemkya is one of the souks of the medina of Tunis. It used to be specialised in selling bechmak (slippers for Turks).

History
This souk was built by Yusuf Dey at the same time as his mosque. It is a part of his foundation made up of religious and economic buildings.
After the disappearance of qadis and mudarris (teachers), the guild of manufacturers of bechmak is dissolved, leading to the disappearance of the souk.

Location
The souk is located near the crossroads of Sidi Ben Ziad Street and Souk El Bey. It surrounds the Youssef Dey Mosque on three sides: east, north and west. Some of the shops are drilled in the platform that carries the mosque.
Nowadays, shops once located on the side of Dar El Bey are annexed to this monument, and those located under the platform are reallocated to other uses, like a bank agency of Société Tunisienne de Banque.

Products
With the installation of Turks in Tunisia, Turkish clothing is introduced. The bechmak (pashmak in Turkish) are then new models of slippers or boots worn by Turks.
The yellow bechmak are worn by men, especially fakirs from the Hanafi rite. Women wear different colours.

296,Souk El Berka,"Souk El Berka is one of the souks of the medina of Tunis. The market traders specialize in the jewellery trade.

History
El Berka was built by Yusuf Dey in 1612 and was meant to sell slaves coming from West and Central Africa. Slaves of European origin, considered rarer and more precious, were not sold in the souk but in private locations because the sale concerned only wealthy potential buyers. This souk turned into a jewelers' souk after the abolition of slavery in Tunisia, decreed by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa in 1846.

Location
The souk is located near the kasbah, the seat of the head of government, Dar El Bey and other souks, for example Souk El Bey, Souk Ech-Chaouachine, and Souk El Leffa. It is perpendicular to Souk El Trouk (Turks).

Architecture
Located at the crossroads of four streets, Souk El Berka takes a square shape and has three aisles separated by two rows of columns. Formerly a wooden platform at the centre was the place where slaves were presented (that was the origin of the name berka) and waited for the outcome of the sale. The place was covered by a central dome and several side vaults.

Khalwa of Sidi Abou Hassan al-Chadhili
Dar Bach Hamba

History
There is no clear consensus as to when the souk was first established. Some say that it was founded in the 9th century under the Aghlabids, an Arab dynasty that ruled significant portions of North Africa. Others say that it was founded in the 7th century by the army corps of the Khurasanid dynasty. In any case, this market existed during the Hafsid dynasty.
There are many explanations for the naming of this market, such as Charles Lallemand's attribution of the souk's name to that of a specific plant (blata), that used to be found in abundance near the palace of Khurasanids.

Products
Following its establishment, this souk specialized in the selling of medicinal herbs, such as thyme, rosemary, chamomile, cauliflower, fennel, wood violet, poppy, coriander, verbena, eucalyptus, ginger, ginseng, as well as other typical products such as beeswax.
In addition to herbs used for medicinal purposes, one would also find animals like the chameleon or the turtle. Chameleons were placed in a kanoun, a clay vessel typically used to hold burning coals, or sacrificed to protect the house from the evil eye, while turtles were placed at the entrance of the house to guard against infidelity in marriage.
Due to the emergence of modern medicine, the number of vendors in this souk has decreased, thus pushing merchants to change their activities. Most vendors in this souk now sell clothes.

322,Souk Ech-Chaouachine,"Souk Ech-Chaouachine is one of the souks of the medina of Tunis. Divided into three parts, it is specialized in chachia trading.

History
According to the chronicler Al Wazir Al Sarraj, Mohamed Bey El Mouradi ordered the construction of the souk in 1691–1692, following the great push that Moorish migrant artisans gave to chachia production and trading at the beginning of the 17th century. The chachia artisans, called chaouachis, were mainly of Andalusian origins, and initiated from the start one of the most important artisan guilds in the country. Their profit generating business was practiced exclusively in Tunis, and followed an important production process and artisan hierarchy, headed by an amine, as all other traditional crafts.

Location
The souk is divided into three parts: Souk El Hafsi on Kasbah Street, Small and Great Chaouachine Souks both located between Sidi Ben Arous Street and Souk El Bey, near Dar El Bey.

Products
As its name indicates, Souk Ech-Chaouachine is specialized in the production and selling of chachia, a boiled wool red colored men's headwear, with blue or black glans to make it more luxurious. Chachia production requires more than two months which includes several steps from crochet all the way to finishing; only the dying and the finishing production steps are executed at the souk.

At the chachia workshops situated within Souk Ech-Chaouachine, artisans and apprentices sit on wooden benches leaning on workshop walls, the master artisans sitting behind a counter to meet customers.

325,Souks of Tunis,"The souks of Tunis are a set of shops and boutiques located in the medina of Tunis, capital of Tunisia. Most of the souks were built under the Hafsid dynasty in the 13th century and near the Al-Zaytuna Mosque.
They are organized in several streets and alleys.

Souk Ech-Chaouachine

Souk El Attarine
Built in 1240 by the Hafsid sovereign Abu Zakariya Yahya, the souk El Attarine or souk of perfumers is the oldest souk of Tunis. It is located just behind the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. When this souk was built, nobles and business owners were the only ones with the right to do this job. Therefore, it was considered one of the finest. Fragrances compounds of rare and valuable species were sold, there was also incense from India and Yemen, as well as some cosmetics.

Souk El Berka
Built in 1612 by Yusuf Dey, the souk El Berka is the old souk of black slaves in Tunis. This souk became later the souk of jewelers.
This souk has a square form, with a wooden platform in the middle which was the place where slaves were presented and waited for the outcome of the sale. Potential buyers were sitting on benches around the souk and participated in the auction. The white slaves, considered the rarest and most valuable, were not sold in the souk but in more remote locations because the sale concerned only wealthy potential buyers. The abolition of slavery in Tunisia was declared by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa in 1846 and caused the transformation of the souk into souk of jewelers specializing in silverware.

Souk El Bey
The souk El Bey was founded by Hammuda ibn Ali. It is located between the Kasbah of Tunis and the souk El Berka. The souk is now specializing in the sale of precious metals.

Souk El Blaghgia
The souk El Blaghgia was founded by Abu Zakariya Yahya in the early 18th century. It is located between souk El Attarine and the Kasbah Street. This souk is specialized in the sale of balghas, a shoe made from leather.

Souk El Kébabgia
Souk El Kebabjia is located west of Al-Zaytuna Mosque, in parallel to Souk El Berka and close to Souk El Trouk from one end and to Souk Es Sekajine from the other end. It is specialized in the traditional clothing accessories.

El Nissa means Women in Arabic. This souk is located at the south of Al-Zaytuna Mosque, near the souk of wool. Women used to come to buy and sell goods.

Souk El Trouk
The name of the souk El Trouk is much debated, but there is an agreement that the word comes from tourk (Turkish) in Arabic with trouk, the word for Antiquities (tirka).
This souk was built in 1620 by Yusuf Dey. It is located between the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the centers of Ottoman power, the Kasbah and Dar El Bey. It was dedicated to Turkish customers and craftsmen; Turkish craftsmen were replaced gradually by Jewish craftsmen.

Souk Es Sabbaghine
The souk Es Sabbaghine, or souk of Dyers, is located on the outskirts of the medina, far away from the Al-Zaytuna Mosque because dyeing is considered a polluting activity. The denomination Es Sabbaghine or Dyers originates from the dyeing of wool, cotton and silk.
Today, the souk sells a variety of products, especially ready-to-wear clothes and shoes, but also fish and meat.

Souk Es Sarragine

328,Al-Hamidiyah Souq,"The Al-Hamidiyeh Souq (Arabic: سُوق ٱلْحَمِيدِيَّة, romanized: Sūq al-Ḥamīdīyeh) is the largest and the central souk in Syria, located inside the old walled city of Damascus next to the Citadel. The souq is about 600 metres (2,000 ft) long  and 15 metres (49 ft) wide, and is covered by a 10-metre (33 ft) tall metal arch. The souq starts at Al-Thawra street and ends at the Umayyad Mosque plaza, and the ancient Roman Temple of Jupiter stands 40 feet tall in its entrance.

History
The souq dates back to the Ottoman era and was built along the axis of the Roman route to the Temple of Jupiter around 1780 during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, and later extended during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Nowadays it is one of the most popular shopping districts in Syria, being lined with hundreds of clothes emporiums, shops selling traditional crafts and jewelry, cafés, grocery stores, food stalls, and ice cream parlors. Before the ongoing Syrian Civil War, it was one of Damascus's main attractions and was visited by many tourists, including Europeans and Gulf Arabs; however, it still remains a popular attraction for locals and Syrians.
Although there have been many violent clashes around Damascus and in some of its districts the souq has not been affected in any way by the ongoing war, but peaceful protests and demonstrations have taken place in the nearby Medhat Pasha Souq, which extends from the Al Hamidiyah Souq.
It was one of the treasures featured in the 2005 BBC documentary Around the World in 80 Treasures presented by Dan Cruickshank.

331,Qasaba of Radwan Bey,"The Qasaba of Radwan Bey is a souq and covered market in Cairo, Egypt, located directly south of the Bab Zuweila gate and just outside the historic walled city. Its dates to around 1650 CE, when its founder, Radwan Bey, initiated a series of constructions in this area. It is the only existing example of a historic covered market street in Cairo. Today it is also known as the Street of the Tentmakers or al-Khayamiya, the last major market dedicated to the sale of decorative textiles known as khayamiya.

Historical background
Patron and context
The market was built by Radwan (or Ridwan) Bey, a Mamluk Bey who dominated the politics of Egypt from 1631 to 1656 (CE). His influence was partly based on the fact that he occupied for a remarkable 25 years the important post of amir al-hajj, the official in charge of organizing the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) which departed from Cairo every year.
The market was built in the context of one of several urbanization enterprises carried out by powerful and wealthy officials in the 17th century which sought to develop the southern districts of Cairo between Bab Zuweila and the Citadel. Radwan Bey reorganized and rebuilt the district which had been formerly occupied by tanneries just outside Bab Zuweila. The area had also been occupied by various residences and a few older religious buildings (such as the Mosque of Salih Tala'i and the Mosque of al-Kurdi, both still standing today). 
The location of Radwan Bey's complex followed a clear logic in the economic geography of Cairo at the time. Since Fatimid times (10th century) the main commercial axis of Cairo was a street with a north–south orientation running between Bab Zuweila and Bab al-Futuh (the southern and northern gates of the Fatimid city, respectively). This street is known today as al-Mu'izz street but was also referred to as the qasaba (""avenue""). It had been the center of the city's commercial and economic activity since its Fatimid foundation. (The well-known Khan al-Khalili, for example, is located along this axis.) South of Bab Zuweila, beyond the old Fatimid walls, the road continued south to Saliba Street and ultimately all the way to the Southern Cemetery of Cairo. Radwan Bey's construction thus helped to extend the main commercial axis of Cairo further south beyond Bab Zuweila as the city developed in this direction.

Construction
Radwan Bey carried out a series of constructions in the area from at least 1629 to 1647 (as recorded in waqf documents).: 196   Radwan established not only a new covered market but also a wikala (caravanserai), a rab' (rental apartment building), one or two zawiyas, a sabil (public water dispensary) and maktab (primary school), two minor mosques, and his own palace.: 197  These various elements were more or less connected together and formed one large complex. Caroline Williams dates the covered market to around the year 1650. Parts of the street were widened and straightened along areas of new construction in Radwan Bey's projects.: 209  Another element of the complex, the combined sabil and maktab, is dated to 1650 by the waqf documents and was most likely the last part of the complex to be built.: 209  
Radwan Bay's palace was adjacent to the market and located just south of it, on the west side of the street. Only a small part of it remains today. The site of his mansion had also been the site of other palaces as far back as the 13th century. Directly north of the palace was located the wikala or caravanserai, also adjacent to the market.
According to historian André Raymond, the market was originally built to house shoemakers in Radwan Bey's time. The association of the market with the guild of tentmakers (khayyāmīn) is also documented from at least the 17th century.: 201

Present day
Over time, many of the elements of Radwan Bey's original development have disappeared or been built over, but the covered market remains relatively well-preserved and one of the most impressive remaining examples of purpose-built commercial/economic buildings in historic Cairo. Only fragments of Radwan's mansion also still remain. Restoration works were carried out on the market between 2002 and 2004 to restore the market's street facades.
Today, the area is popularly known as al-Khayamiya or Suq al-Khayyāmiya, a market dedicated to the sale of khayamiya textiles, a type of traditional decorative appliqué textile used for tentmaking.: 201

Architecture
The whole complex built by Radwan Bey extended around 150 meters along the main street. Some 50 meters or more of this street is covered by a wooden roof pierced with skylights. On both sides of the street, the ground level of the building is built in stone and features large bays or spaces for shops facing the street, while the upper level is built of wood and is supported by thick wooden corbels at regular intervals that allow it to project further over the street. These upper floors provided apartments where the artisans or others could live (a type of building referred to in documents as a rab').
Parts of Radwan's mansion also still remain at the southern end of the covered market, on the western side of the street. Here, a stone portal leads to a courtyard that once was part of the palace. Here one can see some mashrabiya (wooden screen) windows and, on the southern side, a maq'ad or second-story loggia that once overlooked the house's courtyard. Some decorative marble along the walls of the maq'ad still remain.

332,Souq al-Hillah,"Souq al-Hillah (Arabic: سوق الحلة, lit. 'the quarter market'), also known as Souq al-Mūsīqi (Arabic: سوق الموسيقى, lit. 'the music market') is a traditional marketplace (souq) and a popular tourist attraction in the al-Oud neighborhood of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, located in the al-Bat'ha commercial area. It emerged in 1955 in the present-day ad-Dirah neighborhood, and was later relocated to Hillat al-Ahrar during the expansion of the metropolis. The souq includes more than 50 shops that specialize in the sale of musical instruments, such as Oud and Rebab. The souq gets flocked by locals during the month of Ramadan to purchase household items for decoration and is also known to be a major wet market.
The souq thrived between the 1960s and 1980s, a time considered to be the golden era for music and singing in Saudi Arabia, but was severely impacted from the 1980s onward when religious clerics were given more authority over public life in the country. The souq has been visited by artists like Talal Maddah, Naseer Shamma, Taher al-Ahsa'i, Saad Abdullah al-Houti and Mazal bin Farhan.

333,Souk al-Tawileh,"Souk al-Tawileh is a street located in the heart of downtown Beirut, Lebanon.

Overview
Dating back to the Phoenico-Persian period, this street flourished as a prosperous commercial venue until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1975.

Construction
Souk al-Tawileh (‘al-Tawileh’ meaning long in Arabic) is the central north-south street of the Souks district; it once led all the way to the harbor. 1994 excavations in Beirut revealed that the street’s origins dated back to the Phoenico-Persian period. In 1874, the Ottoman urbanization plan of Beirut turned Souk al-Tawileh into a modern commercial street. It flourished until 1975 as a prosperous shopping venue.

History
Souk al-Tawileh (‘al-Tawileh’ meaning long in Arabic) is the central north-south street of Beirut Souks; it once led all the way to the harbor. During the post-war reconstruction of Beirut’s central district that began in 1994, excavations through successive layers revealed that the street’s origins dated back to the Phoenico-Persian period. Souk al-Tawileh thrived in Romano-Byzantine times; it lost its standing after the 551 Beirut earthquake, remaining a simple earth path for a long time. In 1874, the Ottoman urbanization plan of Beirut turned Souk al-Tawileh into a modern commercial street. It flourished until 1975 as a prosperous shopping venue. Its shops often bore French names, and sold clothing, perfumes and other luxury articles. A shop owner whose family had a store in Souk al-Tawileh remembers: ""This large store was one of the oldest and most attractive stores of the city center. It had a surface area of 800 square meters. People came from all over Lebanon and Syria to admire it and buy silver, crystal and porcelain articles, fabrics, hats, gloves, toys…"" Another Beiruti recalls a store located at the end of Souk al-Tawileh, on the corner of Souk al-Franj, that offered rare and exotic fruits as well as French cheeses arranged in ‘wonderful displays.

Covering an area of 6.2 acres, it is situated east of the Masmak Fortress in the Qasr al-Hukm District. It includes more than 260 shops that specialize in the trading of traditional perfumes, cosmetics and abayas.
The settlement lies on the ruins of the Al Ajnab settlement, which gradually went extinct following the dismantling of the city walls and subsequent expansion and modernization of Riyadh in the 1970s. The settlement evolved into Souq al-Suweigah and assumed most of its current form during the Qasr Al-Hukm District Development Project between 1983 and 1992.

It is one of the oldest flea markets in the city where largely used furnitures, carpets and other household related appliances are sold and auctioned. It was previously situated in the al-Manfuhah district until 2014 when the Riyadh Municipality relocated the place to further south of al-Batʼha Street, overlooking al-Anoud Park Mall. 
 The place gets flocked mostly by migrant workers during weekends.

History

Haraj bin Qassim has its origins around the 1940s in the Deera Square, in front of present-day Grand Mosque of Riyadh in the city's ad-Dirah neighborhood. It is attributed to a person called ibn Qassim (transl. Son of Qassem), who is believed to be the eponymous founder of the souq after King Abdulaziz granted him the land for setting up an auction market. It was later relocated to al-Batʼha Street in al-Manfuhah neighborhood in 1971. One branch of the souq was also opened in Asir Street and Raʾīs Street, in close proximity to al-Shumaisi neighborhood but was soon closed down as the site was unspecified for the purpose by the authorities. In 2007, the Riyadh Municipality announced that it would be relocating the souq further south of al-Batʼha Street in a 48-hectares area allotted in the al-Masani neighborhood, in close proximity to the al-Mansurah district. The land was donated by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz and after conducting a well-planned study of the area, the market was shifted there in 2014.

337,Khan el-Khalili,"Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar and souq (or souk) in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs. The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single building in the area; today it refers to the entire shopping district.

History
The site of Khan el-Khalili in Fatimid times (10th-12th centuries)
Cairo was originally founded in 969 CE as a capital for the Fatimid Caliphate, an empire which by then covered much of North Africa and parts of the Levant and the Hijaz. Jawhar al-Siqilli, the general who conquered Egypt for the Fatimids, was ordered to construct a great palace complex to house the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two palaces were eventually completed: an eastern one (the largest of the two) and a western one, between which was a plaza known as Bayn al-Qasrayn (lit. 'Between the Two Palaces'). The site of Khan el-Khalili today was originally the southern end of the eastern Fatimid palace as well as the location of the burial site of the Fatimid caliphs: a mausoleum known as Turbat az-Za'faraan ('the Saffron Tomb').: 57  Also located here was a lesser palace known as al-Qasr al-Nafi'i (today the site of the 19th-century Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar).
Under the Fatimids, Cairo was a palace-city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operation of the regime and its city. The first attempts to open the city to merchants and other outsiders took place in the later Fatimid period, on the initiative of powerful viziers. Between 1087 and 1092, Badr al-Jamali, the vizier under Caliph al-Mustansir, undertook the task of enlarging the city and building the stone walls and gates that still partly exist today. At the same time, he also opened the city to the common people, but the decision was quickly reversed. Between 1121 and 1125, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, vizier under Caliph al-Amir, undertook many reforms and construction projects, including the creation of a mint, known as the Dar al-Darb, and of a customs house for foreign merchants, known as the Dar al-Wikala. These were placed in a central location not far from the current site of the 15th-century Madrasa of al-Ashraf Barsbay. This introduced foreign trade into the heart of the city for the first time.: 199 (vol. II)

Development of Cairo as economic center (12th-14th centuries)
Cairo was only definitively opened to all people under the rule of Saladin, who dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 and embarked on the construction of a new fortified Citadel further south, outside the walled city, which would house Egypt's rulers and state administration. The old Fatimid palaces in the city were opened up to redevelopment. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by everyday Egyptians and frequented by foreign travelers. At the same time, the nearby port city and former capital of Fustat, until then the economic hub of Egypt, was in a slow decline, further paving the way for Cairo's ascendance.
The main axis of Cairo was the central north-to-south street known as the Qasaba (now known as al-Muizz Street), which ran between the gates of Bab al-Futuh and Bab Zuweila and passed through Bayn al-Qasrayn. Under the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, this avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments. These constructions were usually sponsored by the sultan or members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone for international trade and commercial activity thereafter.
An important factor in the development of Cairo's economic center was the growing number of waqf institutions, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. Funding sources often included the revenues of designated shops or other commercial establishments. Among the early and important examples of this institution in Cairo's center was the complex of Sultan Qalawun, built in 1284–85, which included a madrasa, hospital, and mausoleum. A part of the complex's revenues came from a qaysariyya (a bazaar or market complex made up of rows of shops) that was built in front of the nearby Ayyubid-era madrasa of al-Salih. This qaysariyya was a prominent early example of the purpose-built commercial structures that came to be erected in Cairo under the Mamluks as part of a waqf. Qalawun's qaysariyya had a front on the Qasaba street while some of its shops were reached by an inner alley off the main street.

Foundation of Khan al-Khalili in the Mamluk period (14th-15th centuries)
Over many years, space along the Qasaba avenue steadily narrowed as new constructions encroached on it and open spaces disappeared. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were instead built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where some space was still available. Instead of hosting mobile market stalls that were assembled in open spaces, the city's souq areas were progressively replaced by fixed stone structures with built-in spaces for individual shops. This was partly a consequence of the authorities wishing to impose greater control on commercial activities: fixed structures could be counted, taxed, and regulated more easily than makeshift market stalls that could come and go. As the city became denser and space ran out, builders preferred to build multi-storied structures known as a khan (Arabic: خان) or a wikala (Arabic: وكالة), a type of caravanserai (inns for merchants). These types of buildings were centered around an inner peristyle courtyard where merchants could store their goods, while the upper levels were used as living quarters. Their street facades typically had spaces for shops at ground level. In this way, a commercial zone could extend around and between multiple khans.
By the time of Sultan Barquq (r. 1382–1399), the first Burji Mamluk sultan, Egypt had been significantly affected by the ravages of the Black Death but continued to be the center of great economic activity, with many commercial and religious buildings still being constructed at this time.: 147  During Barquq's first reign (1382–1389) his Master of the Stables (amir akhur), Jaharkas al-Khalili, demolished the Fatimid mausoleum (Turbat az-Za'faraan) to erect a large khan at the heart of the city. The khan became known as Khan al-Khalili, after his name. The name eventually came to denote the entire district. Al-Khalili reportedly disposed of the bones of the Fatimid royal family by throwing them into the rubbish hills east of the city.: 57 
Later Mamluk elites also built commercial structures in the vicinity and beyond. In Sultan Qaytbay's time one of his amirs, Yashbak min Mahdi, built the Rab' al-Badistan, an apartment complex for renters, just across from the Khan al-Khalili. Qaytbay himself built the Wikala of Sultan Qaytbay further east, near al-Azhar Mosque. By the late 15th century, the district around Khan el-Khalili had become the major center of foreign trade, including the sale of slaves and precious stones.: 62

Re-development by Sultan al-Ghuri (early 16th century)
In the early 16th century, Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypt's last effective Mamluk sultan (r. 1501–1516), modified the layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large Wikala named after him nearby, he demolished the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511. It became known as the Khan al-Fisqiya (""Khan of the Fountain"") for centuries, until later being known as the Wikala al-Qutn (""Wikala of Cotton""). Al-Ghuri also reconfigured the adjacent area into a souq known as the Suq al-Nabulsi, which featured monumental stone gates. He also tried to impose a more regular grid plan on the surrounding district.: 179  Along with the stone gates, this sort of complex resembled what in Ottoman cities was known as a bedesten: a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold and which often had roofed streets and locked gates at night (similar in some ways to a qaysariyya). It is possible that al-Ghuri's construction was done in imitation of such commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, as this was a time when the Ottoman Empire was the major rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkish merchants were increasingly prominent in Cairo.: 179 
What remains today from al-Ghuri's time is the Suq al-Nabulsi and its two ornate stone gates, as well as the façade and entrance of the Wikala al-Qutn. All these structures are located along the street known as Sikkat al-Badistan. The western gate was originally known as Bab al-Silsila but is known today as Bab al-Badistan, while the eastern gate, across from the Wikala al-Qutn's entrance, was originally known as Bab al-Nuhhas but is now known also as Bab al-Ghuri.

	Remains of Al-Ghuri's constructions (circa 1511)

Later history (16th century and after)
From the Mamluk period onward, the Khan al-Khalili area was made up of several major khans or wikalas grouped together, with souq streets existing between them. By the end of the Mamluk period in the early 16th century, there were 21 khans and wikalas in the district. From al-Ghuri's reign onward, the district became associated with Turkish merchants and during the Ottoman period (after 1517) the Turkish community of Cairo was centered here. The Wikala al-Qutn, which had replaced the original Khan al-Khalili structure, was inhabited by Turkish merchants.During the Ottoman period the prosperity of Cairo's souqs waxed and waned in accordance with local political conditions and international economic conditions. While Cairo was no longer an imperial capital, it still played a highly important role in the trade networks of the Ottoman Empire. New khans and wikalas continued to be built. The construction of new commercial buildings began to shift to the west of the Qasaba avenue as this was the only area where there was still space to build.: 71  New constructions were relatively rare in the 16th century but became more common again in the 17th century. Many old buildings were also restored, altered, or rebuilt, especially during the 18th century. In contrast with the Mamluk period, new religious complexes were rarely built, but many small mosques or prayer areas were added inside existing commercial buildings.: 77  By the end of the 18th century, just before Napoleon's invasion, some 39 khans and wikalas existed in the area of Khan al-Khalili and its adjoining districts.: 70  One late example of a large wikala built in the heart of Khan al-Khalili is the Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar (or Wikala al-Silahdar), built in 1837 to replace a ruined Mamluk-era khan. It is still partially standing today, directly across from Bab al-Ghuri.
The district underwent significant modifications and re-developments again in the 19th and 20th centuries alongside major developments in the urban fabric of modern Cairo to the west. Al-Muski Street, a popular market street today, was created by cutting across the fabric of the old city to create a street roughly perpendicular to al-Muizz Street (the old Qasaba avenue). It runs from al-Hussein Square in the east to Midan 'Ataba ('Ataba Square) in modern downtown Cairo to the west. Among other important re-developments was the construction of about two dozen new residential blocs with ground-level shops in the eastern sector of the souq, initiated by the princess Shawikar in the late 1930s. This eastern area is now one of the most frequented by tourists.: 225

Present day
The Khan el-Khalili today is occupied by local merchants and traders and is significantly geared towards tourists. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewelry. The adjoining goldsmiths' souq is still important for locals.: 81  Although less widespread than in earlier days, many crafts workshops continue to operate within the bazaar (usually in the courtyards or upper floors of buildings) and in the surrounding districts, manufacturing some of the products sold here or exported elsewhere.
In addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses (Arabic: مقهى, romanized: maqha), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. The coffeeshops are generally small and quite traditional, serving Arabic coffee and usually offering shisha. One of the oldest and most famous coffeehouses is El Fishawi's, established in 1773.: 109 

The Khan al-Khalili proper is delimited by al-Muizz Street to the west, al-Muski Street to the south, and the Mosque/shrine of al-Hussein to the east, with its northern boundary less clear. In reality though, the bazaar area spreads beyond these limits and is closely integrated into the surrounding districts.  For example, al-Muski street, which runs perpendicular to al-Muizz street and cuts across the south end of Khan al-Khalili, continues over a long distance and functions as a major souq street frequented by locals for much of its length.
In addition to the important Mosque and shrine of al-Hussein, Al-Azhar University and the Al-Azhar Mosque are also nearby. The monumental area of Bayn al-Qasrayn is also just northwest of the district. Some of its historic Islamic buildings were once maintained with the help of revenues from designated shops and commercial buildings in the area.

In literature
Naguib Mahfouz's novel Midaq Alley (1947) is set in an alley in Khan el-Khalili.
Pivotal events of Neal Stephenson's novel The Confusion (2004), which is the second book of his The Baroque Cycle series, are set in the caravanserai within Khan el-Khalili.
Mohammed Avdol, one of the main characters of Stardust Crusaders, the third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, owns a fortune-telling shop in Khan el-Khalili.
P. Djeli Clark's short story The Angel of Khan el-Khalili takes place in this area and other parts of Cairo.

Terrorist attacks

The market was a target of terrorism during the spate of attacks in Cairo in April 2005. The suicide attack in the market, on April 7, killed 21 people (eleven Egyptians, two French tourists, one American, and seven foreigners of unidentified origin). It was the first attack in the series; this attack drove away tourists from Egypt in general and Khan el-Khalili in particular for some time.
The market was again a target of terrorism on 22 February 2009. In this attack a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 22 people were injured.

338,Souq Waqif,"Souq Waqif (Arabic: سوق واقف Sūq Wāqif, ""the standing market"") is a marketplace (souq) in Doha, in the state of Qatar. The souq sells traditional garments, spices, handicrafts, and souvenirs. It is also home to restaurants and shisha lounges. The original building dates back to the late 19th to early 20th centuries in a traditional Qatari architectural style. It was renovated in 2006.

Location
It is located in the district of Al Souq which is situated in the centre of Doha. As it was a market used for trading activities, the area used to be located immediately adjoining the shore to allow for boats to access it. Although still facing the water, the direct link to the water front for boats is now divided by a major road and the recently completed park.

History
The souq was founded at least a century ago in proximity of the dry river bed known as Wadi Musheireb. It was a gathering place where Bedouins and locals would trade a variety of goods, primarily livestock goods. However with the boom in prosperity in the 1990s, the Souq fell into decline and in 2003, most of it was destroyed in a fire. This event initiated a restoration program by the government in 2006, with the purpose of preserving its architectural and historical identity. The first phase of restoration was funded by the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al Thani and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Buildings constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008. Traditional heating methods are employed by utilizing wood and bamboo imported from various areas of Asia.

Tourism and attractions
The souq is considered a tourist attraction within Doha.
A yearly spring festival around April hosts many theatricals, acrobatics and musical performances. An event featuring WWE wrestlers, called Souq Waqif Storm, attracted the most spectators. There was discussion over the possibility of a repeat festival.

Pet area
There are pet stalls in Souq Waqif which sell a variety of domestic pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles and birds. The sub-par living conditions of the pets has been the subject of advocacy campaigns in recent years, with proponents arguing that the animals suffer from a lack of proper healthcare and exposure to adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, some customers allege that stall owners falsify vaccination records. There is also a separate area in the souq reserved for falcon handling. The falcon souq, as it's called, sells not only falcons but also the needed accessories such as landing pads and GPS guidance systems for the birds. Within the vicinity is also a Falcon Hospital.

Al Rayyan Theatre
A 980-seat indoor theatre known as Al Rayyan Theatre is located in the souq.

340,Muttrah Souq,"Muttrah, (Arabic: مطرح) administratively a wilayah (province), is located in the Muscat Governorate of Oman. Before the discovery of oil in Oman, Muttrah was the center of commerce in Oman (Muscat). It is still a center of commerce as one of the largest seaports of the region is located there. Other landmarks include Souq Muttrah, a traditional bazaar and Sour Al-Lawatiah, a small community of houses surrounded by an old wall. To the south lies Muscat District.

Demographics
Muttrah had an estimated population of about 8,000 people when diplomat Edmund Roberts visited in the early 1830s. The district population was 234,225 as of the 2016 Census, up from 200,578 in 2014, making it the most densely populated district in the nation.
The Sūr al-Luwātiyah neighborhood is home to the al-Luwātiyah tribe, which speaks the Indo-Aryan Luwati language. The language and people were first mentioned historically by the Omani historian Ibn Ruzayq. The Luwātiyah appeared to have settled in Oman in waves of immigration from Sindh between 1780 and 1880, bringing the language with them. They insularized themselves in Sūr al-Luwātiyah, preserving their language. They have worked in the incense (بخور), jewelry and clothes businesses as well as in general trade. In the predominantly Ibadi Sunni arena of Oman, they make up the majority of the local Shia population.

Economy
In the mid 19th century, Muttrah had a vessel repair industry.

Souq Muttrah
Al Dhalam (""Darkness"" in English) Souq is the local name for the Muttrah Souq. The Muttrah Souq is one of the oldest marketplaces in Oman dating back two hundred years. It is located adjacent to the harbor of Muscat and has seen immense trade in the age of sail, being strategically located on the way to India and China. It was named after darkness because of the crowded stalls and lanes where the sunrays do not infiltrate during the day and the shoppers need lamps to know their destinations. The name of the market has been drawn specifically from the part that extends from Al Lawatiya Mosque to Khour Bimba where the place is really full of stores and stalls and the narrow area of lanes does not allow the sunlight to enter. The market was a source of supply for Omanis where they could buy their needs in the 1960s when life requirements were simpler than today. Most of the goods were imported, in addition to local products like textiles, fruit, vegetables and dates.
In the past, the market was built from mud and palm leaves, which suit the high temperatures and the hard climate conditions and hence were the best available materials to build the market at that time. Today, the Muscat Municipality has renovated and decorated the market to maintain the popular style but has also introduced modern amenities and redecorated the market heavily to attract tourists and make the shopping experience comfortable for tourists as well as other ordinary shoppers.
The market becomes more crowded and active during Eid seasons when Omanis come from all over the country to buy garments and jewelry.
The main thoroughfare of the souq carries mainly household goods, shoes and ready-made garments. Further inside, there are mixed smells of frankincense, perfume oils, fresh jasmine, and spices. There are also tiny shops (on the side streets and alleyways leading up to the souq) with Omani silver, stalls of white dishdashas and embroidered kumahs, brightly colored cloth, and multicolored head scarves. Shoppers can even obtain old Arabian muskets at these souqs.
Other items sold at the souq include Omani pots, paintings, hookah pipes, framed khanjars (daggers), leatherwork, and incense.
The souq goes by various names: Market of Darkness, due to its myriad of alleys and roads lined by shops that block the sun during the day. The east and west parts are also known as ""the small market"" and ""the large market"".

Infrastructure
Port Sultan Qaboos
Commonly called the Muscat Port, Port Sultan Qaboos is one of the main commercial ports in Oman. It is Oman's premier maritime gateway, enjoying a prime location in the politically stable sultanate. Situated in a natural harbour 250 km south of the Strait of Hormuz on the Indian Ocean coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Port Sultan Qaboos' location makes it an ideal hub, not only for the Persian Gulf but also the Indian sub-continent and markets in East and South Africa.
The location of Port Sultan Qaboos offers considerable savings in steaming time when compared to other ports. The port's tariff compares very favorably with others across the region. The already impressive infrastructure, skilled manpower, fast and efficient handling operations and documentation clearance system in PSC will be further enhanced this year.
During the reign of Sayyid Sultan bin Ahmed in the 18th century, Oman's trading activity again increased and the capital area's two harbours — Muscat and Mutrah — diversified, Mutrah was quickly established as a commercial port while Muscat was used for naval operations. The ruler's son Sayyid Said continued to expand maritime commerce although it again went into decline after his death in 1856. Maritime activity was limited to the import of essential items, mainly from India by old-style wooden dhows. Ships had to anchor offshore and sometimes wait for days before cargo could be unloaded manually into small boats. 

This was all to change with the accession of HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said who inaugurated a new era of maritime commerce and prosperity in Oman when he established Mina Qaboos (now Port Sultan Qaboos) in 1974.
Port Sultan Qaboos has been operated and managed by Port Services Corporation S.A.O.G. since November 1976. Until 1981, the traffic was essentially conventional cargo. With the advent of containerisation, PSQ developed two of its berths to handle container vessels and these facilities were fully operational by 1983–1984. 
PSC embarked on computerization of its operations and back office in 1984. The first system to handle container movements became operational from 1985 to 1999. Thereafter the computer applications were enhanced to cover all back office operations including invoicing and accounts.
In the early 1990s, the port infrastructure was further enhanced. Two more berths were converted to handle multipurpose vessels including container vessels and were equipped with additional three quay-side gantry cranes. The marshaling yard and empty yard was provided with rubber tyred gantries. On date, the port is an ideal transshipment hub for the upper Persian Gulf and Red Sea ports trade flows.

In popular culture
Muttrah is also a map in a popular Battlefield 2 mod, Project Reality. It was also featured on The Amazing Race in the eighth episode of its 17th season.

342,Souk Okaz,"Sūq ʿUkāẓ (Arabic: سوق عكاظ [suːq ʕʊ.kaːðˤ]) is a marketplace at ʿUkāẓ, between Nakhla and al-Ṭāʾif, in Saudi Arabia. It was the largest and best known souq in pre-Islamic times. Today it is a popular tourist destination.

History
Sūq ʿUkāẓ was a seasonal market which operated for two weeks each year during the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah. It competed with the fairs of Majanna and Dhu ’l-Majaz̄, which were also held near Mecca at the same time of year. It was active from approximately 542-726 CE. Strategically located at a central point on the Spice Route through Western Arabia, its growth in the sixth century was partly caused by the Byzantine-Persian wars, which made it harder for Mediterranean markets to access Mesopotamian trade-routes. ʿUkāẓ lay in the territory of the Hawāzin tribal group, and its functions were controlled particularly by the Tamīm.
The gathering was facilitated by the sanctity of the sacred months during which it was held and its proximity to the holy plain of ʿArafāt. Although primarily for commerce, the market of ʿUkāẓ was an important center where Arabs would meet to formalize tribal rules, settle disputes, pass judgments, make agreements, announce treaties and truces, hold sporting competitions and races, poetry competitions, and religious gatherings; it has been compared in this respect to the ancient Greek institution of the panegyris. It was especially important for poetry competitions, which served to formalize rules of Arabic language verse, grammar and syntax.
The site and its sacrality was significant in the Fijār War of the late sixth century CE (between the Qays-ʿAylān, including the Hawāzin, on the one hand and the Quraysh and Kināna tribes on the other). The war was precipitated by the murder of ʿUrwa al-Raḥḥāl of the Banū ʿĀmir ibn Ṣaʿṣaʿa by al-Barrāḍ ibn Qays al-Ḍmıī Kinānī while ʿUrwa was escorting a Lakhmid caravan from al-Ḥīra to ʿUkāẓ during the holy season. This was considered sacrilegious by the pagan Arabs, hence the war's name, ḥarb al-fijār ('the war of sacrilege'). The site of the market gave its name to a battle in the fourth and final year of the war, yawm ʿUkāẓ ('the day of ʿUkāẓ', also known as yawm Sharab).
The site is prominent in later legends of pre-Islamic Arabian heroes: it allegedly saw preaching visits from the Islamic prophet, Muḥammad and the semi-legendary Christian Quss ibn Sāʿida, and is the scene of some stories about Hind bint al-Khuss. Yet the importance of ʿUkāẓ declined after the rise of Islam, because the increasingly sprawling caliphate facilitated new trade-routes, and altered the social roles of Arabian tribes. The market was definitively destroyed by the Khārijites in 127 AH (725-26 CE), who sacked it.
The location of Sūq ʿUkāẓ was disputed until historian Muhammad bin Abdallah al-Blahad rediscovered it. A major study was published in 1960 by Saʿīd al-Afghānī.

Modern Souq
A modern souq has been recreated at the location of the historic souq. Each year's souq honors a different poet. The souq covers 14 million square meters of land. In modern times, as in the past, there are lectures, sporting competitions, poetry, artwork, and items for sale. The souq has 200 shops selling different goods including pottery, silverware, glassware, wall arts and historical manuscripts.

343,Beirut Souks,"Beirut Souks (Arabic: أسواق بيروت) is a major commercial district in Beirut Central District. With over 200 shops, 25 restaurants and cafes, an entertainment center, a 14 cinema complex, periodic street markets, and an upcoming department store, it is Beirut's largest and most diverse shopping and leisure area. Beirut Souks also features piazzas, and public space. Designed in five separate commissions by international and Lebanese architects, Beirut Souks offer 128,000 sq. m of built-up area interspersed with landscaped pedestrian zones.
The souks have historically been at the commercial heart of Beirut. They sustained severe damage during the Lebanese Civil War and were rebuilt by Solidere according to the ancient Roman-Greek street grid, maintaining the historic landmarks and pre-war street names.

History
Beirut Souks reconstruction revives aspects of the ancient street network that stems from Roman times....Housing blocks created an orthogonal street plan that survived for centuries and is still present in the alignment of Souk Tawila. The Souks area with its shopping colonnades and villas prospered during Romano-Byzantine times, until the 551 A.D. when the earthquake destroyed it.Solidere
Souk al-Tawileh and Souk al-Jamil were a favorite shopping destination before the civil war and were frequented by Lebanese and Europeans alike since they housed fashionable boutiques and haute-couture houses,
while Souk al-Franj functioned as Lebanon's biggest fruit, vegetable and flower market.

Destruction
During the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was the scene of fierce battles between warring factions; after a few months of fighting, the brief ceasefire in September 1975 allowed the business owners of Beirut's central district to evacuate their shops' assets before fighting resumed turning downtown Beirut, including its souks into a sniper  patrolled no man's land. In October 1975, fighting extended to the souks, gunmen blew up shops and set others on fire. The destruction of the souks affected Christian and Muslim merchants alike. The battle of the souks lasted for 2 and half months until December 1975 before extending to the residential area of Ras Beirut
During the spring of 1983,  the Antoun Bey Khan, a historic caravanserai and a landmark of the souks was demolished  to clear the view towards the sea.

Reconstruction
Reconstruction of Beirut's central district began as soon as the guns fell silent in 1990. Dar Al-Handasah was commissioned by the Lebanese Council for Development and Reconstruction to prepare a master plan for the rebuilding of the dilapidated central district. Henri Eddeh,  a senior architect planner at Dar al-Handasah proposed a complete demolition of the historical city center which was to be replaced by modern buildings and infrastructure.

The notion of bulldozing the entire cityscape stirred a heated polemic within the intellectual circles and widespread opposition to the master plan led to the adoption of an alternate strategy aiming at preserving and renovating what could be salvaged of Beirut's historic buildings. The new master plan drawn by Lebanese architect Jad Tabet was approved by the Lebanese parliament and its implementation started in September 1994; a private share-holding company (Solidere) was created by the Lebanese government to manage the entire process of reconstruction and rehabilitation of Beirut's central district. Except for specific landmarks that were later salvaged and restored, a large part of the souks' medieval buildings were too damaged to be saved. The void left by the destruction of the Souks left a gap in Beirut's identity, Solidere sought to bring back the souks historic commercial function at the heart of Beirut and appeal to the mercantile community that had fled to the periphery during the 16 year civil war. Solidere launched an international design competition to rebuild the souks while in keeping with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks. The contest was won by José Rafael Moneo Vallés who designed the southern souk and British architect Kevin Dash who designed the Gold souks. The construction of the souks were entrusted to Lebanese firm Hourie. The master plan for the Beirut Souks was approved by ministerial decrees  which preceded the launch of the reconstruction project. Costs of reconstruction were estimated at 100 million dollars and work duration between 18 months and 2 years. The souks was set to open in 2000 but inauguration was postponed due to licensing delays related to political issues; meanwhile the construction of the underground parking was underway. In 2004 Solidere received the license and work on the souks began to be withheld in the aftermath of summer of 2006 war and the subsequent political instability.

Opening
Beirut Souks were opened to the public on October 2, 2009, after a 10-year delay due to political instability. The Gold Souk's opening was also delayed due to financial disagreements between the syndicate of Expert Goldsmiths and Jewelers in Lebanon and Solidere.  Visitors on the opening day wandered through the few opened shops while construction works were still underway.

Location
Beirut Souks are located in Beirut Central District, they are delimited by Mir Majid Arslan Avenue to the North, Rue Weygand street to the south, Patriarch Howayek to the west and  Allenby street to the east.

Architecture and description
The new Souks are a low rise complex of two components: the South Souks and the North Souks. The Souks were designed in five different commissions by international and Lebanese architects. They offer 163,010 square metres (1,754,600 sq ft) of floor space and 17,307 square metres (186,290 sq ft) of pedestrian areas that follow the ancient Greek street grid.

South souks
The South Souks were designed by Rafael Moneo in collaboration with Samir Khairallah while the Gold Souk was designed by Kevin Dash and his Lebanese counterpart Rafic Khoury. The Souks were designed as interconnected open spaces with many access points; there are 200 shops located along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades with 49 of these shops located in the Gold Souk. The new Souks have retained their Hellenistic street grid layout as well as their historical names; these are: Souk al Tawila (the long souk), Souk Arwam, Souk Jamil, Souk Ayyass, Souk Sayyour, Souk Bustros and Souk Arwad.

Conservation
Solidere's plan  preserved the heritage left by the different civilizations marking the Beirut Souks' historic location from the Phoenician era until the French mandate. The archaeological findings recovered in the Souks, which have been restored, include the ancient Phoenician commercial quarter, the Medieval moat, the Mameluk Koranic madrassa of Ibn Iraq Al Dimashqi, and the Byzantine mosaics excavated on site.

Shops
Beirut Souks has over 200 shops, including:

Awards
The Beirut Souks received in 2009 the Capital Issues Award under the category of Architectural excellence. The award was collected on behalf of Solidere by Angus Gavin on December 22, 2009.

Incidents
On 15 September 2020, a fire broke out in a Zaha Hadid building at Beirut Souks, close to the city's port, but was quickly extinguished.

344,Qaysari Bazaar,"A Qaysari bazaar is a type of covered bazaar typical of Kurdistan and Iraq.
Arbil (Kurdish: Hawler) contains an extensive Qaysari, just south of the citadel in the center of town that was first established in the early 13th century AD.  The Qaysari is entered through the numerous alleys that surround it.  Once inside, shoppers walk through a maze of narrow paths between the shops, underneath a roof of corrugated metal.  Most alleys feature a unique product that is sold by a majority of the vendors in that location.  The northeast corner of the Qaysari contains a north-south alley offering honey and dairy products, such as yogurt and cheeses. Many shops offer Chai Kurdi (Kurdish tea) as a complimentary drink with good business from the local tea vendors in the bazaar. It is very popular prior to festivities such as Newroz (Kurdish New Year) in which business excels with larger crowds and customers.

Synopsis
As with other marketplaces in China, wholesale and retail trade are both seen here, as well as restaurants. Jingshen is the largest seafood marketplace in Beijing. Tourists are advised to ""keep expectations low in terms of a clean shopping environment as it can be a little messy in there"" because ""most sections of the market are devoted to large-scale, wholesale purchases"". Retail vendors are located on ""the first floor of a three-floor building located at the center"" of the marketplace.
""The main areas of the JSM include six operating areas, including a seafood operating area, a frozen product operating area, an aquatic products trading hall, a dry goods seasoning operating area, a shell and crab operating area, and a car aquatic products trading area, and a supporting service area. There are about 800 booths.""

History
The JSM banned individual visitors from entering the market since the beginning of the Chinese Spring Festival 2020. ""At present, the business hours of the merchants are from 4 am to 3 pm, and all are cleared at 3 am. Before the epidemic, the Beijing-Shenzhen Seafood Market had been open 24 hours,"" said one representative of the market. Clients ""are called online to pick up the goods"".
During week 20 of 2020, the JSM was shut down due to a new outbreak of COVID-19. The market was closed for disinfection on 12 June after it was found that a newly identified coronavirus patient had visited it.
Salmon from sushi restaurants was seen as a possible vector for transmission. The 52-branch Chaoshifa Market in Beijing said it had stopped selling salmon. Four out of every five of its branches sold salmon imported from Norway. Major supermarkets in Beijing including Carrefour and Wumart have stopped selling salmon. Alibaba’s Hema Fresh supermarket had also pulled the fish. Norway held a 45 percent share of market for fresh salmon in China from January to April 2020. Beijing airport was closed for ""salmon flights"" from 12 June.

It is a row of about 200 shops that line either side of the road for about a kilometre.

History
Burma Bazaar was established by Burmese immigrants, who were Tamil refugees who fled Myanmar during the early 1960s. The government set aside land for the Tamil refugees returning from Burma during the 1960s. The bazaar is run by the Burma Tamizhar Marumalarchi Sangam, an association that has been set up to look after the interests of the traders since 1966.

The bazaar
The bazaar extends to about a kilometre along the Chennai Beach railway station. There are an estimated 200 shops in the bazaar. With several passengers coming out of the station every few minutes, the market appears busy all the time. It is estimated that over 100,000 people pass through this corridor every week.
Per 2017 estimates, there are over 600 shops in the bazaar employing over 5,000 people.
It had been listed as a notorious market between 2009 and 2017 by the USTR for selling various counterfeit goods and pirated media and software.

In media
Ayan, a 2009 Indian film, shows the operations of selling CDs, software, electronics, perfumes, and other goods in great detail. Other Indian films which make references to the market include Vattaram (2006) and Kacheri Arambam (2010).

347,Bazaar of Tabriz,"The Bazaar of Tabriz (Persian: بازار تبریز, also Romanized as Bāzār-e Tabriz Azerbaijani: تبریز بازاری, also Romanized as Tabriz Bazari)  is a historical market situated in the city center of Tabriz, Iran. It is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East and the largest covered bazaar in the world. It is one of Iran's UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

History
Tabriz has been a place of cultural exchange since antiquity. Its historic bazaar complex is one of the most important commercial centres on the Silk Road. A bazaar has existed on the same site since the early periods of Iranian urbanism following Islam. The bazaar was mentioned by the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, who claimed to have passed through it while journeying on the Silk Road. 
Al-Maqdisi in 10th century, Yaqut al-Hamawi in ca. 1213 CE, Zakariya al-Qazwini in ca. 1252 CE, Marco Polo in 1271 CE, Odoric of Pordenone in ca. 1321 CE, Ibn Battuta in ca. 1330 CE, Ambrogio Contarini in 1474 CE, Hamdallah Mustawfi in around 13th to 14th century, John Cartwright in 1606 CE, Jean Chardin at the time of Suleiman I of Persia, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in ca. 1636 CE, Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri in ca. 1642 CE and dozens of other explorers and historians have written about the Bazaar of Tabriz, which shows its importance and significance through the different periods of history.
Located in the center of the city of Tabriz, the structure is divided into rows, many devoted to particular categories of product. These include Amir Bazaar (for gold and jewelry), Mozzafarieh (hand woven rugs, sorted by knot size and type), Bashmakhchi Bazaar (shoes), Kiz Basdi Bazaar, and Rahli Bazaar (produce). Tabriz and its bazaar were at their most prosperous in the 16th century, when the town became the capital city of the Safavid kingdom. The city lost this status in the 17th century, but its bazaar has remained important as a commercial and economic hub in the region and on the silk road. Although numerous modern shops and malls have been established in recent years, Tabriz Bazaar has kept its vital role as economic hub of the city and northwestern Iran.
The bazaar was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2010.

Ceremonies
The bazaar is used for some important religious ceremonies.

Restoration
In 2000, the Historical Hermitages Organization of Iran begin a restoration project of the Bazaar, with the full participation of the shop owners. The rehabilitation project won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2013.

348,"Russian Bazaar, Ashgabat","The Russian Bazaar or Gulistan (Turkmen: Gulistan söwda merkezi; Rus bazary, Гулистан сөвда меркези; Рус базары) in Ashgabat is one of the largest and oldest covered markets in the Turkmenistan. It is located in the centre of the city. The ""Russian Bazaar"" was built in the period of 1972—1982 by the design of the Russian architect Vladimir Visotin among other buildings that were included in the ""Ashgabat Reconstruction Program of 1970-1980."" The building was done in the Soviet Modernism style and decorated by the Turkmen sculptor Klych Yarmamedov who adored the building with a magnificent abstract sculpture placed in one of the building's corners. Despite the emergence of new stores and malls in Ashgabat, markets continue to be popular among locals and tourists and are regularly visited by foreign delegations. The range of goods is enormous, and the bazaar also houses shops and eateries. In 2001 it was reconstructed by the Turkish company Ekol, with updated outlets, shops and foodstalls. The complex was covered with white marble. In 2007, there was a fire in the clothing section of the market.

350,Toqi Telpak Furushon,"The Toqi Telpak Furushon (Uzbek: Toqi Telpakfurushon) is a bazaar located in Bukhara, which forms part of its historic centre. This architectural monument was built in 1571 during the reign of Shaibani ruler Abdullah Khan II. Currently, it is included in the national list of real estate objects of material and cultural heritage of Uzbekistan.

History
The Toqi Telpak Furushon was built between 1570 and 1571. Toqi Tepakfurushon was constructed during the reign of the Shaybanid ruler Abdullaxon II in the 16th century and was located in close proximity to the marketplace in Bukhara. In the middle centuries, various names were given to this place over time. It was known for selling different items such as fur hats, sheepskin coats, magnificent fabrics, and exotic turbans. The name ""Toqi Tepakfurushon"" has been associated with this marketplace in different eras. The Toqi Tepakfurushon dome is preserved and prominent, making it second in size in that direction. For example, it has been known by names like ""Choharsuyi Oxan"", ""Toqi Kitobfurushon"", and ""Toqi Khwaja Muhammad Parron"". Later names include ""Toqi Allofi"" and ""Toqi Ordfurushon"". During the middle centuries, booksellers' shops were also present in the marketplace. In the vicinity of Toqi Tepakfurushon, there are currently ironworking shops and bathhouses. Nowadays, Toqi Telpakfurushon hosts trade stalls and craft workshops. In the years of independence, Toqi Telpakfurushon underwent renovations.

Architecture
Toqi Tepakfurushon is constructed from adobe, timber, stone, and clay. The building's architect brilliantly connected five arched niches, shaped like alcoves, in an orderly and symmetrical arrangement, combining them into a central dome with arched doors. The dome is still intact, with entrances. This building has a unique hexagonal structure, and its central dome has doorways. Toqi Tepakfurushon serves as a showcase for the shops that sell various traditional clothing, jewelry, and other types of attire. According to waqf documents, it was constructed between 1570 and 1571, with the junction of the five arches visible on different sides. The main dome has six tiers of walls, and the surroundings are surrounded by smaller domes. The main dome has a diameter of 38 meters, a height of 10 meters to the springing of the vault, a square shopping area of 28 meters, and a street width of 14 meters. In the past, the area beneath the dome was occupied by clothing and book merchants.

Location
Toqi Telpak Furushon is located about 300 meters south of Toqi Zargaron, at a point where five streets meet. About 10 meters to the west and south is the Magok-i-Kurpa Mosque.

351,Old Kandahar,"Old Kandahar (locally known as Zorr Shaar; Pashto: زوړ ښار, lit. 'Old City', also Shahr-i-Kona (Dari: شهر کهنه) in Dari) is a historical section of the city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.

The citadel
It is widely believed that after conquering Mundigak in 330 BC, Alexander the Great marched southeast with his army and laid out what is now Old Kandahar and named it Alexandria. The site was likely chosen as a way to protect its inhabitant from the occasional heavy sandstorms coming from nearby Reg District (Sand District). Others suggest that the foundation of the citadel was probably laid out during the Iron Age, and became a major fortress of the Achaemenid Empire. It served as the local seat of power for many rulers in the last 2,000 years. The region became part of many empires, including the Mauryans (322 BC–185 BC), Indo-Scythians (200 BC–400 AD), Sassanids, Arabs, Zunbils, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Timurids, Mughals, Safavids, Hotaks, and the Durranis. It was one of the main cities of Arachosia, a historical region sitting in Greater Iran's southeastern lands and was also in contact with the Indus Valley civilization. The city has been a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Southern Asia and Central Asia, controlling the main trade route linking the Indian subcontinent with the Middle East, the rest of Central Asia and the Persian Gulf.
The city was often fought over by the Safavids and the Mughals until 1709, when Mirwais Hotak made the region an independent kingdom and turned Kandahar into the capital of the Hotak dynasty. The city was destroyed by Nader Shah in 1738 after defeating Hussain Hotak, the last Hotak ruler. After the destruction of this old city all the remaining inhabitants were relocated to a nearby area which became known as ""Naderabad"" for a short time, named after Nader Shah. By 1750, Ahmad Shah Durrani had laid out the current city of Kandahar and turned it into the capital of his Durrani Empire.

Epigraphical discoveries
Important inscriptions in Greek, dating to the 3rd-2nd century BC were discovered in or around the site of Old Kandahar, including the Kandahar Greek Edicts of Ashoka, the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription also from the time of the Indian ruler Ashoka, and the Kandahar Sophytos Inscription.

353,Street markets in London,"Street trading is selling from a stall, stand, or vehicle in the street rather than in a market hall or square. A collection of regular, and adjacent, street traders forms a street market. Where traders operate on their own, from a regular location, these are variously described as isolated pitches, scattered sites, or miscellaneous sites. Peripatetic traders are termed pedlars.

History
Cheapside was the oldest known market in London, possibly established in the late ninth century during the reign of King Alfred.
The large number of street markets in London is due to the 1327 granting of market rights to the City of London. This allowed the city to control the establishment of markets within a radius of six and two thirds miles [10.7 km] being the distance a person could be expected to walk to market, sell his produce and return in a day. The city's market rights caused London's markets to develop differently from the rest of England in their own legislative framework.
The City of London used these rights to prevent the establishment of private markets within the growing urban area outside of the city. Since shops were still a rarity and street trading fell outside the definition of a market, street traders would collect produce from the city's wholesale markets and wheel it to busy thoroughfares on carts from which they would then sell. This practice continued into the late twentieth century:

Albert died when George was 12 and he left school to earn a living. He was charged with taking a horse-pulled cart to Covent Garden, load up with produce, and drive it through crowded streets to Inverness Street Market, where his brother Billy ran stalls.
Traders were self-regulating. They paid no fees and were subject to no legislation or bylaws.

London Labour and the London Poor
Henry Mayhew’s 1851 survey of London lists 37 street markets comprising 3,137 stalls with an additional 9,000 street traders not fixed to a street market.

Early regulation
Section six of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 134) effectively prohibited street trading:

No goods or other articles shall be allowed to rest on any footway or other part of a street within the limits of this Act, or be otherwise allowed to cause obstruction or inconvenience to the passage of the public, for a longer time than may be absolutely necessary for loading or unloading such goods or other articles.
Following public meetings and press criticism, the act was amended within weeks. Section one of the Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act 1867 (31 & 32 Vict. c. 5) exempted traders:

The sixth section of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, prohibiting the deposit of goods in the streets, shall not apply to costermongers, street hawkers, or itinerant traders, so long as they carry on their business in accordance with the regulations from time to time made by the Commissioner of Police, with the approval of the Secretary of State.
Whilst the legal threat to the livelihoods of traders had receded, street traders were now subject to regulation by the police. The police required that stalls were no more than 9 feet (2.7 m) wide 3 feet (0.9 m) deep and 4 feet (1.2 m) apart from each other. Where the police deemed a stall to be obstructing the public highway, they could be confiscated and traders would need to pay for the storage along with a fine.

London County Council’s survey
In 1893, the London County Council’s survey of London's markets listed 112 street markets. These markets comprised 5,292 stalls, 4,502 belonging to costermongers and the rest being maintained by shopkeepers.

Beginning of licensing
The London County Council (General Powers) Act 1927 (17 & 18 Geo. 5. c. xxii) replaced police regulation with a new licensing regime administered by metropolitan borough councils.

Current management of markets
Despite reorganisations of London's local government and changes to the underlying legislation, the licensing regime has continued. As of 2020, street trading in London is regulated under the London Local Authorities Act 1990 (c. vii) (as amended) and part III of the Food Act 1984 (c. 30), depending on the local authority. Whilst the London Local Authorities Act 1990 allows the regulation of street trading on private roads and areas open to the public within 7 metres of any road or footway, most local authorities only regulate street trading on the public highway.
In 2014 there were 43 street markets in central London (Camden, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, and Wandsworth).
In the early 21st century, the City of London has taken a much more circumscribed interpretation of its market rights, limiting itself to wholesale markets. This has allowed a proliferation of farmers, niche, and street-food markets on private land in central London. There were 27 private markets in central London in 2014.

Independent management of street markets
Whilst most street markets are managed by local authorities, some are managed by volunteers or private companies:

Lower Marsh has been managed by a local business improvement district, WeAreWaterloo since 2012,
Venn Street is run by a community group, and
Swiss Cottage Wednesday farmers market has been managed by London Farmers’ Markets since 1999.
A number of other markets have been relaunched, and run, by volunteers before been taken back into local authority management:

Broadway Market was relaunched by the Broadway Market Traders and Residents Association in 2004 though management has now reverted to Hackney Council,
between 2010 and 2018 Chatsworth Market was managed by Chatsworth Road Resident and Traders Association, and
from 2013 to 2015 Queen's Crescent was run by the Queen's Crescent Community Association.

354,Kök Bazaar,"Kök Bazaar (literally Green Bazaar) is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan (on the crossroad between Zenkov and Jibek Joly streets). Since its inauguration in 1875, the market has been an important trading point in Almaty. The market currently sells spices, prepared foods, produce, textile, furniture, and a wide variety of different objects, including antiques. 
The area originally served as a guest yard for traveling merchants and caravans. In 1887, Almaty suffered a major earthquake, which destroyed most of the area (including the bazaar). In 1927, the bazaar was reconstructed and received the name Central Farm Market. However, it eventually became known as the Kök Bazaar. The bazaar is currently a major tourist attraction in Almaty.

History
In 1875, the Gostiny Dvor, which consisted of two low pavilions stretching along Torgovaya Street, was built on the territory of the shopping area, designed by the architect Jan Kozell-Poklevsky. The customer and sponsor of the construction was the Semipalatinsk merchant Sadyk Rafikov, one of the most influential people in the city of that time.
During this period, this complex was called ""Gostiny Dvor and its merchants"". It received visiting guests, entrepreneurs, trade agents from all over Central Asia, neighboring countries and even from island Japan. The market remained a monument not only to the commercial and industrial prosperity of the region, but also to architectural and urban planning art. Its stone shops, entertainment and entertainment attractions, storage sheds, shopping arcades, flowing irrigation ditches and fountains, erected for prayer by Muslim merchants. In its trade and other qualities, the bazaar was not inferior to the best markets of Turkestan. Visiting merchants set up their mansions along the perimeter of the business square. From the Kök Bazaar, the city began to grow to the southwest.
In 1887, a major earthquake happened in Verniy, as a result of which the city was severely destroyed. There was practically nothing left of Gostiny Dvor. After the earthquake, Gostiny Dvor was rebuilt, but lost its former importance as the city's main trading place, as the city authorities began to organize additional new bazaars focused on one type of product throughout the city: this is how hay, vegetable, horse and livestock markets appeared.
With the emergence of collective farms in the second half of the 1920s, large-scale trade in agricultural products, vegetables, and fruits resumed. In 1927, the Gostiny Dvor was rebuilt and acquired a new name Central Collective Farm Market. But among the people, the name Kök Bazaar stuck more.
In the 1940s, the bazaar consisted of long, rectangular rows of canopies with wooden stalls. The bazaar also sold live cattle, dairy products, apples of the Almaty Aport variety. Fruits and vegetables were brought from the neighboring collective farms. During World War II, the bazaar was the only place where it continued to sell goods for money, and not give out by cards. But the prices were very high due to the war. 
In the 1970s, the wooden market was demolished. In its place, in 1975, a covered building appeared in the style of brutalism. The main architect of the project was Mark Pavlov. The bazaar was designed as a structure of several levels. The main pavilion had 800 seats, the summer market had 200 seats, and the parking lot had 400 cars.
In 2017, a new shopping pavilion was built on the site of container pavilions and open trade counters, where an open market parking was located until the early 2000's.

A number of shows promoting handicrafts and handlooms are held at the exhibition hall in the complex.

""The Xinfadi Market is more of a one-stop-shop where wholesalers in the city would purchase vegetables, meat and seafood hall after hall.""
The market was responsible in 2016 for 70% of Beijing's fresh vegetables, more than 80% of Beijing's fresh food and drinks, and all of the city's imported fruit. Every year, 14 million tons of products are sold at the market for an estimated 50 billion RMB.

History
In the last years of the 20th century, Beijing was home to four major food markets: Xinfadi, Yuegezhuang Market (1986), Dazhongsi Market (1986) and Sidaokou Market. Tongxian County latterly set up a market as part of a ""new national network of Central wholesale markets"", after the 1985 liberalization of trade.

Background and establishment
Xinfadi Village, where the market is located, was originally named ""Xinfendi"" (simplified Chinese: 新坟地; traditional Chinese: 新墳地; pinyin: Xīnféndì, literally ""new grave land""), because in 1958 a graveyard located there was leveled to create farmland. The area gradually turned into a settlement, and the name was changed to ""Xinfadi"" (roughly ""newly developed land""). The village mainly contains sandy, loamy, brown soil, suitable for planting vegetables.: 220 
On May 10, 1985, the Beijing Bureau of Commodity Prices decided to relax control of the prices of seven key agricultural products: pork, beef, mutton, eggs, poultry, marine fish, and vegetables.: 74  On May 30, the municipal Party committee and city government convened a vegetable work conference and decided to ""revitalize buying and selling"" and ""allow food from other parts of the country to come into Beijing"".: 226  As a result, after farmers from near Xinfadi Village handed over the required quantity of vegetables to the government, they began to set up roadside stands to sell the remainder. These stands gradually turned into a street market.: 151 
Over time, many farmers from outside Beijing joined the street market, resulting in disorganized commerce and traffic jams. Local officials repeatedly tried to drive them out, without success, so a member of the Fengtai District Bureau of Industry and Commerce recommended that a wholesale market be established in the village, welcoming the farmers instead of trying to remove them. Xinfadi Village Vegetable Company manager Zhang Yuxi (Chinese: 张玉玺; pinyin: Zhāng Yùxǐ) decided to build a market. On May 16, 1988, 15 villagers, led by Zhang, used wire netting to enclose one hectare in Xinfadi Village. They used 150,000 yuan of funding (50,000 each from the district, township, and village) to establish a farmers' market.: 152  In the early days of the market, Zhang, who lacked experience setting up a marketplace, personally sold vegetables in Jining, Zhangjiakou, Luohe, and other places.

Growth
By 1989, the area used by Xinfadi Market grew to 1.7 hectares; in 1992, it grew to nearly 7 ha; and in 1999, it grew to close to 70 ha.: 152  During this continual growth, Xinfadi Market used low fees and simple procedures to attract customers, and on holidays they did not charge administrative fees. The number of transactions gradually grew, and in 1996 the market's vegetable sales exceeded 1.1 billion kilograms, representing 40% of vegetable sales in Beijing. The market's scope also expanded to include eight categories: vegetables, fruits, grains, oil, meat, seafood, eggs, and condiments. In 2003 the market accounted for 60% of Beijing's vegetable trade. In 2003, Xinfadi Village established 19 residential buildings, dubbed ""Xinfadi Executive Paradise"" (Chinese: 新发地经营者乐园), to provide housing for managers at Xinfadi Market who were from other places. In 2004, non-market businesses started to move in.: 280–281 
In 2006, 50 individual butcher stallholders sold roughly 200 kilograms of meat each per day. An independent observer said that he saw health inspection certifications on both the stalls and the displayed carcasses.
In 2010, Xinfadi Market occupied 100 hectares, with transactions worth 36 billion RMB.: 153 
As of 2016, the market covered 121 hectares (230 hectares including the ""service area"" with hotels, restaurants, and other establishments that serve the market).
The 2017 renovation plan, which was budgeted for $220 million, planned for the market's area to be reduced to 68 hectares.

COVID-19 outbreak
On June 13, 2020 at 03:00, the public health authority temporarily closed the Xinfadi market due to a COVID-19 outbreak. A ""wartime mechanism"" was put in place. Beijing CCP Party Secretary Cai Qi, city leaders Zhang Yankun, Du Feijin, Chen Yong, Wei Xiaodong, Cui Shuqiang, Wang Ning, Lu Yan, Yang Jinbai, Qi Yanjun, and secretary general of the municipal government Jin Wei participated in this decision.
Mass popular testing at the market in week 20 ""detected more than 50 new infections"". Tourism to the capital has been curtailed as a result, as well as sporting events. Cai said on 13 June that ""We must ponder our pains, draw lessons from it, and always tighten the string of epidemic prevention and control."" The authorities, who had been urged by the CCP ""to act decisively"", had found over the previous two days ""confirmed cases and positive infections via nucleic acid testing for two consecutive days"" as of the morning of 13 June. Analysis from 40 environmental samples also tested positive for COVID-19. It was reported that workers in the market and local residents were required to undergo PCR testing. People who had been to the market since 30 May were required to receive COVID-19 tests. During the weekend of 13 June, soldiers were seen in full uniform trooping in lock step to control the marketplace.
Eleven neighbourhoods near the market were put under lockdown to control the outbreak. Officials announced that they would arrange temporary stands to sell fruits and vegetables, so that produce would still be available in Beijing while the market was closed.
On 15 June, 27 new cases were reported in Beijing, bringing the city's total to 106 since the previous Friday. Lockdowns were declared in residential communities surrounding the market. Authorities barred residents of high-risk areas from leaving Beijing. Taxi services were barred from bringing Beijing residents out of the city.
On 16 June, the government closed all schools in Beijing, as Cai described as ""extremely grave"". On 17 June, government cancelled 1,000 airplane flights, although the Civil Aviation Administration of China had yet to declare public notice.
On 19 June an official said that ""the majority of samples collected from the aquatic and soybean product areas at the market have tested positive for COVID19"". As of 20 June, the authorities had sealed off 40 communities in Beijing, and told residents ""not to leave their homes to avoid cross infection"". Dayanglu Market halted its retail business on 21 June. There are 3,061 vendors in Dayanglu, ""whose meat, poultry and egg transactions account 50% of the city's total.""

359,Baščaršija,"Baščaršija (Cyrillic: Башчаршија; pronounced [baʃ.tʃǎr.ʃi.ja]) is Sarajevo's old bazaar and the historical and cultural center of the city. Baščaršija was built in the 15th century when Isa-Beg Ishaković founded the city.
Baščaršija is located on the north bank of the river Miljacka, in the municipality of Stari Grad. On Baščaršija there are several important historic buildings, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and sahat-kula. Today Baščaršija is the major tourist attraction of Sarajevo.

Etymology
The word Baščaršija derives from the Turkish language. The word ""baš"" which is ""baş"" in Turkish literally means ""head"", but in some contexts also means ""primary"", ""main"", ""capital"". ""Čaršija"" which is ""çarşı"" in Turkish means ""bazaar"" or ""market"".
Although the suffix 'ja' (modern Turkish: '(y)a') means 'to' in Turkish, implying that the full name of the district literally translates to 'to the main bazaar', it is more likely that the ending -ija is a Bosnianism, as many Turkish loanwords have the same ending to conform to Bosnian grammatical rules. In the nominative case, the place has always been referred to in Turkish as ""Başçarşı"" only, without ""ya"".

History
Before the arrival of the Ottomans in the largest settlement on Sarajevo field was the village square Tornik, which was located at the crossroad of the roads where today is the Ali Pasha's Mosque. Baščaršija was built in 1462 when Isa-Beg Isaković built the Ishaković han, in addition to its many shops.
Around the main entrance, the Bazerdžani čaršija was formed. The čaršija Kazaz is situated to the west, and to the north sit both the čaršija Sedlar and Sarača. The most significant buildings constructed during this period were mosques. Baščaršija's famous mosque was built by Havedža Durak in 1528, and Gazi Husrev-beg built his mosque in 1530.
Gazi Husrev-beg built a Gazi Husrev-begova Medresa, a library, a haniqah, the Gazi Husrev-beg Hamam, the Gazi Husrev-beg bezistan, the Morića Han, sahat-kula and other tourist attractions in Baščaršija. Gazi Husrev-Beg was buried in the harem of his mosque, beside the harem is the türbe of his freed slave and the first mutevelija of his vakuf, Murat-beg Tardić.
Along with Islamic places of worship erected at that time, Baščaršija is also the location of the Old Orthodox Church, built sometime during the 16th century and first mentioned in Ottoman sources from 1539, and also the first Sephardic Jewish temple the Old Synagogue, built between 1581 and 1587. Just next to the Old Synagogue (Bosnian: Stari Hram = Old Temple) the New Synagogue (Bosnian: Novi Hram = New Temple) was built a short time after.
Today the Jewish community uses the more recently erected synagogue just across the Miljacka river, while both Old and New synagogue buildings are used as Jewish cultural centers. The New Synagogue was donated by the Jewish community to the city of Sarajevo and serves as a gallery called Novi Hram. The Old Synagogue building was turned into the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered to be one of the finest exhibition spaces in the former Yugoslavia.

During the 16th century a number of commercial facilities was built, such as bezistans, hans, and caravanserais. Sarajevo was an important center of trade in the Balkans and had three bezistans (today the Gazi Husrev-begov bezistan and Brusa bezistan are still standing). There were colonies of Venetian and Ragusan traders, and Baščaršija had approximately 12,000 commercial and craft shops. 
After the earthquake in 1640 and several fires in 1644 and 1656, Sarajevo was burned and devastated by the troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy in 1697. Travel writer Evliya Çelebi wrote:

""The čaršija has in everything, one thousand and eighty stores that are a model of beauty. The čaršija is very attractive and built according to plan.""
The city of Sarajevo didn't expand significantly until the 19th century. With the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878, foreign architects wanted to rebuild Sarajevo into a modern European city. A fire contributed to this process, destroying parts of the Stari Grad.
With the liberation of Sarajevo in 1945 after the Second World War, a committee decided that the market should be gradually demolished, believing that it had no role in a modern city. However, the plans were cancelled, and the buildings were left standing.

360,Landa bazaar,"Landa bazaar, also known as Linda bazaar, or Lunda bazaar, is a type of flea market in Pakistan, where secondhand imported goods are sold.

Sourcing
Pre-owned clothing, donated in countries such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is often distributed by charitable organizations. These organizations receive the items at no cost and sell them in bulk, priced per kilogram. Subsequently, the clothing is transported to Pakistan, where it is sorted and sent to markets.

Re-exportation
The low-cost, second-hand clothing arriving in Pakistan attracts merchants from countries like Afghanistan, India, and Turkey who purchase these items at a slightly increased price. As a result, Pakistan imports these affordable garments, selects the highest quality products in optimal condition, and exports them in an unusual instance of double-arbitrage.

Consumers tend to compare products before purchasing them to maximise value and quality. They are contrasted with convenience goods, which are purchased frequently and are usually low value (such as food). Shops offering comparison goods are often clustered in central business districts or in out-of-town retail centres, where retailers can compete over their offers.

362,Shopping addiction,"Shopping addiction is characterized by an eagerness to purchase unnecessary or superfluous things and a lack of impulse control when it comes to shopping. It is a concept similar to compulsive buying disorder (oniomania), but usually has a more psychosocial perspective, or is viewed as a drug-free addiction like addiction to gambling, Internet, or video-games.

Behavioural manifestations
There are three kinds of behavioural manifestations of shopping addiction, with different repercussions. These can be displayed together or independently and in more or less intense ways. Nevertheless, they are closely related and appear joined in people who seriously suffer from this disorder.

First is the attraction towards the consumer stimulus, which is the addiction to purchasing as a leisure activity. This is about the uncontrolled and excessive draw to use shopping as a leisure activity, usually in an exclusive and overwhelming way. While activities such as window shopping, visiting shops or spending time in commercial centres is a common and socially accepted desire activity, an addict is differentiated as one in whom this excessive attraction to purchase interferes with the normal development of life and damages their relationships with others, becoming an obsessive and uncontrolled activity. 
Although shopping addiction and compulsive purchase are conceptually different, they are interrelated and both are manifestations of the same problem: the lack of self-control when buying and to restrain impulses.  Shopping addiction is understood as the eagerness for constantly making new purchases of unnecessary or superfluous things. The concept of compulsive purchase is related to the psychological process which causes many people not to be able to control their impulses and wishes of buying, and subjects them to reflexion and evaluation before purchasing. A basic behavioural characteristic of people who have serious problems of consumer addiction is that their purchases are unnecessary and unsatisfactory. Addicts may feel pleasure or relief when they give in to the shopping wish, but regret it afterwards. In cases of people with severe problems of shopping addiction, this remorse can lead to very deep feelings of blame and discomfort.
Lack of economic self-control: this is the serious and permanent inability to adjust the habits of spending to the economic means of the individual. This is not about one's ordinary or unexpected spending making life difficult, but is an absolute inability to control the personal or family income in a rational way, and to discipline their buying, no matter how superfluous it is. A manifestation of this lack of control is usually the excessive use of indebtedness.
The final result is the active or “guilty” over-indebtedness; this is derived from the improper behaviour of the consumer.

Impact on the general population
The rate of people who have problems of shopping addiction is a very controversial matter, because the dividing line between pathological behaviours and those behaviours which, even if excessive, are socially accepted, is very difficult to determine. However, shopping addiction and other manifestations of the lack of self-control on spending are widespread problems which are constantly expanding. Studies using samples of the general population show that between 8% and 16% of the people have problems with excessive or uncontrolled purchases. Clinical studies give much lower figures, however, between 2% and 5%. According to the European Report on the programme for the prevention and treatment of personal problems related to consumer addiction, personal purchasing habits and over-indebtedness, 3% of European adults and 8% of European young people have a level of shopping addiction which could be considered as pathologic, that is, which seriously affects the life of the people who suffer from this. Other estimates for the prevalence of compulsive buying range from a low of 2 percent to 12 percent or more (in the U.S. population.
Most of people who have these problems neither receive nor ask for treatment. Those that ask for help only do it after years of suffering, when the addiction has caused very serious economic repercussion and has harmed the relationship with their family and social environment. For this reason and due to the lack of social consciousness about this problem, the unrecorded figure of people who suffer from these problems is very high. In addition to the severe cases of shopping addiction, an important part of consumers (between 30% and 50% of the population) have deficiencies with spending self-control or excessive purchases. According to the European Report, 33% of European adults and 46% of the European young people have minor or moderate problems with shopping addiction or lack of economic self-control.

COVID-19
The number of shopping among Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen X generation consumers during and after Covid-19.  These generations are inclined to current trends of technology platforms like TikTok among others serve and they offer a place for consumers to follow and buy advertising products of their choice. During COVID-19, consumers purchase products that they might not need but so because of boredom without thinking about the financial implication of their actions. Research carried out by (Handayani and Nilasari, 2021) among 100 millennial generation consumers to test their shopping behavior using primary data. The result shows that, majority of the millennial generation consumers prefer to use online shopping platforms to purchase their brands, in terms of pricing and also how consistent the manufacturers will be in case they need them. Their purchasing behavior is depicted by impulsive trend-driven purchases, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, online platforms have 60% influence on current consumption trends. Many people were buying because they fear there will be shortage of what they want or do not even want due to the pandemic.

Relationships with other disorders
The relationship of shopping addiction with other psychological disorders – especially with those regarding depression or anxiety - has been studied. This addiction has also been related with low self-esteem and with personality features such as impulsivity, materialism and hedonism.
Depression problems are the most frequent consequence in the most serious cases of shopping addiction. This is due to the fact that many consumers use shopping as a means to compensate or to face depressive states. Edwards (1992) in a research to study the influence of some personal variables in two groups, one of shopping addicts and another of non-addict consumers, came to the conclusion that depression is a trigger for shopping addiction problems. In agreement with this data, other researchers have pointed out the high incidence rate of depressive disorders among shopping addicts: Mc.Elloy (1994) placed at 25% the rate of addicts with depressive problems, Lejoyeux (1998) at 61%, and Black, Montaban and Gabel (1997) at 60%. More recent research shows that shopping addicts usually have feelings of leading an unsatisfactory and listless life, without any hope or excitement. In these cases, by means of purchase, the addicts seek for a way of escape, a satisfaction, even if momentary to compensate and to bear the depressive feelings.
Cole (1995) carried out research with a sample of 420 people and come to the conclusion that anxiety has an essential role in shopping addiction, as an antecedent or a triggering factor. In another study, Valence (1988) revealed that as the level of anxiety rises, the possibility of developing shopping addiction grows. Clinical research on the rate incidence of anxiety disorders in shopping addition also shows this relationship, although the percentage changes a lot: Shlosser (1994) 42%; McElroy (1994) 80%, and Christenson (1994) 50%. Research carried out by Garcés and Salcedo in 2005, based on a sample of 253 young people, concluded that the anxiety trait has a significant influence on shopping addiction but, by itself, is not determinant.

Population differences
Gender
A higher rate of incidence of shopping addiction in women was pointed out in the first research works on the subject, so much so that it was considered a “women problem”.  Some researchers thought that this was a specifically female manifestation of problems of depression or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Others, from a psychoanalyst point of view, thought that it was a problem very similar to kleptomania and they related it to sexual repression to explain the high rate of incidence in women.  Research carried out in the last century confirmed this difference although disagreeing on the scope. Other hypotheses have been stated to explain these differences. For example, people more easily develop addictions to behaviours they normally undertake and most home purchasing is still done by women. Since shopping is for many women one of their most usual activities, as obligation or as entertainment, it easily becomes an important mechanism of escape, facing other problems and ending up being an addiction. Another possible cause is that the most striking cases of shopping excesses are usually related to clothes, shoes, cosmetics and accessories, products which relate to physical appearance and are more frequently bought by women. The excessive purchase of other products such as electronic, computer or D.I.Y  ones, accessories of cars, etc., that are frequently done by men usually goes unnoticed.
This appraisal has been confirmed by research on different products bought by addicted women and men. Several studies (Flaber, O´Guin and Krych in 1987, Scherhorn 1990, and McElroy in 1994), agree that women spend more on clothes, footwear, perfumes and, in general terms, men tend to spend more on sports equipment, car accessories and electronic products. The 1999 European Report established that women are drawn by activities like going shopping or window shopping, spending time in malls, escorting other people shopping. Moreover, they more frequently use shopping as a means of facing states of sadness, depression or downheartedness. However, the Report does not indicate significant differences between men and women related to economic self-control or impulsive purchase.

Age
Research carried out on people undergoing treatment, as well as on the general population has revealed a negative correlation between age and addiction. As the age of people increases there is a lower number of shopping addicts. These data were confirmed by the 1999 European Report.
It must be noted that the age of diagnosis is much later than the age when the problems of addiction begin. Most addicts have the first symptoms of addiction in their twenties, but do not ask for help nor accept treatment until more than ten years afterwards. To explain the higher incidence of shopping addiction in young people, it has been shown  that younger people have been born, and have grown up, in an increasingly consumerist society and they have endured the impact of publicity and marketing from birth. On the contrary, it is very unusual to find shopping addiction problems in people older than 65 years.

Different theorical approaches
Clinical approach: since ancient times, cases of people who bought in an uncontrolled way have been described, but the first relevant references to shopping addiction appear in the beginning of the twentieth century with Kraepelin and Bleuler.
They analysed cases of people, usually women, who were not able to control their excess of purchasing and they considered this behaviour to be a symptom of other psychological diseases: depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, problems with control of impulses, etc. The clinical approach is also followed by the psychoanalytic theories that interpreted this behaviour as close to kleptomania and these would be manifestations of internal conflicts. Until the 1980s, this clinical approach was the predominant one in psychology and psychiatry. Shopping addiction was considered an individual disorder of impulse control or obsessive compulsive disorder, and its higher incidence rate in women and its relations with depression problems were emphasised.

Psychosocial approach : Since the 1980s a significant increase in the number of people with important problems of lack of control in shopping and spending has been established. Given the fact that this increase was parallel with the spreading of the values and behaviour of the consumer society, these disorders started to be considered as an individual manifestation of a general social problem. A model taking this approach was one by Javier Garcés and Alejandro Saucedo, who regard shopping addiction as ""the tip of the iceberg” that is, the most intense manifestation of a general problem which affects, to a greater or lesser extent, a great deal of the population. The behaviour differences between the average consumer and the shopping addict are more quantitative than qualitative. Advertising and commercial influences, which cause in some people serious problems of shopping addiction or excessive indebtedness, also contribute to excessive consumer behaviour in many others. This model is graphically described by the “consumerist pyramid”. Another model is the one defended by Helga Ditmar, which could be classified as a mixed model, since she considers that shopping addiction problems are caused by the conjunction of two factors: a high level of materialism and a high discrepancy between the real self-concept (how the person sees themselves) and the ideal self-concept (how the person wishes to see themselves).
Shopping addiction as a drug-free addiction or as a social addiction: In this theoretical perspective, not incompatible with the previous approaches, shopping addiction is usually included among the so-called “drug-free addictions”, such as addiction to gambling  and, specifically, within a number of addictions grouped together as social addictions such as the addiction to Internet, video-games or mobile-phones.

Diagnosis
Since people buying more than they need is usual and accepted, even the most excessive behaviour takes a long time before being considered pathological. Shopping addiction generally manifests between 20–30 years old, but is not usually detected until several years after, when the addiction has led the person to ruin and bankruptcy.
There are usually two stages in coping with the problem. First, people around the addict or the health or social services detect the problem and try to treat it. When, because of the seriousness of the case, it is not possible to solve it in this way, specialised professionals, such as psychologist or psychiatrics, take part. The diagnosis and evaluation of shopping addiction is based on the analysis of confirmed behaviours and their consequences. Specific tests or questionnaires, as the FACC-II (Questionnaire on the psychological aspects of consumer addiction, debt and personal spending habits) are also used. These specific questionnaires or tests are useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of shopping addiction problems, and to drive the therapies in a proper way. FACC-II is one of the most specific and widest. The Edwards Scale is another approach which measures the tendency to compulsively buy. All these resources, as well as personal interviews of the addict and people who surround them, reports and other documents, enable knowledge of when people buy, what they buy and the methods of payment used. Signs of addiction can include: planning future purchases, unable to stop the urge of shopping, rush of dopamine when buying, regretful after purchased items, financial issues begin, and buying unnecessary items.

Treatment
Pharmacological treatment
The inclusion of this problem in the obsessive-compulsive disorders and its relation with depression has led to some use of antidepressants as a treatment.  Within antidepressant drugs, special attention has been paid to those related to serotonin, a brain neurotransmitter. This substance is supposed to be related to deficiencies in stimulus control, so that medicines like fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, which raise the level of serotonin in the brain, would be a pharmacological alternative to treat shopping addiction. Even though results are not conclusive, in the nineties some research was carried out which supported the effectiveness of these treatments, at least in certain cases.

Behaviour therapy
The treatment of shopping addiction – in contrast to other addictions as the gambling, alcohol or smoking - cannot seek to permanently remove the addicts from the behaviour. After therapy, they must be able to face consumer stimuli which surround them and maintain self-control. Because of this, the most usual therapies are behavioural ones., especially stimuli control and exposure and response prevention.

Guardianship
In the treatment of shopping addiction it is often very useful for other people – usually friends, relatives or educators -to  help addicts control their expenses and impulsive purchases. In these cases, addicts have to accept that all their money, credit cards, bank accounts, etc., will be controlled by the guardian. This person becomes their “voluntary guardian”. It is possible that the addict has also to accept not to go alone to stores and other limitations, even legal.

Self-registration techniques
Self-registration techniques involve addicts noting  down their activities to be able to remember and analyse them. This can range from a simple personal accountability of income and expenses, in the cases of minor economic lack of control, to a detailed diary of purchase, events and feelings, in the more serious cases of shopping addiction. Self-registration is useful to get clues about the behaviour, which could otherwise go unnoticed to the addicts themselves.  Moreover, it is, in itself, a therapeutic means that helps addicts understand and reflect on their behaviour. These techniques are effective in improving economic self-control and avoiding impulsive purchase and are generally included, one way or another, in all programmes of treatment.

Self-help groups and group therapy
Some experiences of self-help groups and group therapy have been carried out in a very similar way to those used in other addictions. Preliminary evidence suggests that group  for compulsive shoppers could be effective.

Gear acquisition syndrome (G.A.S.)
Since the 1990s, the acronym G.A.S. (gear acquisition syndrome) has been used in internet forums and magazines for musicians, audio engineers and photographers to denote compulsive accumulation of technical equipment. The acronym was coined by Steely Dan guitarist Walter Becker in a 1994 satirical Guitar Player magazine column titled ""The Dreaded G.A.S."" Describing a fellow guitarist's family room covered entirely with guitars, Becker speaks of ""guitar acquisition syndrome"":You undoubtedly know someone who has it. Reading this rag, you probably have it yourself. Or will have it someday soon or would like to have it. You may think it's cool. But it's not cool. Not anymore. How many Strats do you need to be happy? How many Strat copies, each extensively modified to be able to produce the variations in tone that once would have required maybe four different guitars? How many knobs and switches does that Strat need?The acronym ""G.A.S."" was used on internet forums subsequently, replacing ""guitar"" with ""gear"". A musicological study published in 2017 conducted an online survey among 418 electric guitar players inquiring their affliction with ""G.A.S."" The study finds the main reason for compulsive gear acquisition among musicians to be the quest for stylistic flexibility. ""Gear acquisition syndrome"" has been called an example of commodity fetishism.

363,Shopping list,"A shopping list is a list of items needed to be purchased by a shopper.  Consumers often compile a shopping list of groceries to purchase on the next visit to the grocery store (a grocery list). There are surviving examples of Roman and Bible-era shopping lists.
The shopping list itself may be simply a scrap piece of paper or something more elaborate.  There are pads with magnets for keeping an incremental list available at the home, typically on the refrigerator, but any magnetic clip with scraps of paper can be used to achieve the same result.  There is even a specific device that dispenses a strip of paper from a roll for use in a shopping list. Some shopping carts come with a small clipboard to fit shopping lists on.

Psychology
Use of shopping lists may be correlated to personality types.  There are ""demographic differences between list and non list shoppers; the former are more likely to be female, while the latter are more likely to be childless.""  Remembering a shopping list is a standard experiment in psychology.  Shopping with a list is a commonly employed behavioral weight loss guideline designed to reduce food purchases and therefore food consumption.  Studies are divided on the effectiveness of this technique.
Some studies show approximately 40% of grocery shoppers use shopping lists, while other studies show 61–67% use lists. Of the items listed, 80% were purchased.  However, listed items only accounted for 40% of total items purchased. Use of shopping lists clearly impact shopping behaviour: ""Written shopping lists significantly reduce average expenditure.""

Incremental lists
The list may be compiled immediately before the shopping trip or incrementally as shopping needs arise throughout the week.  Incremental lists typically have no structure and new items are added to the bottom of the list as they come up.   If the list is compiled immediately before use, it can be organized by store layout (e.g. frozen foods are grouped together on the list) to minimize time in the store.  Preprinted lists can be similarly organized.

364,Shopping hours,"Customs and regulations for shopping hours (times that shops are open) vary between countries and between cities.

Shopping days and impact of holidays
Some countries, particularly those with predominantly Christian populations or histories, do not allow Sunday shopping. In Islamic countries, some shops are closed on Fridays for noontime prayers. In Israel many shops are closed on Friday evenings and Saturdays during the daytime for Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath).
Each state in Australia sets its own standard trading hours, but in most of the country the shops are open seven days a week for at least part of the day. These also depends on their day-to-day needs.
For some shops and other businesses in culturally Christian countries, Christmas Day is the only day in the year that they are closed.
In the United States and Canada, nearly all retail stores are open every day of the year except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and Easter Sunday. Some suburban and smaller communities often close on Sundays. For example, Bergen County, New Jersey, next to New York City, completely bans Sunday shopping. Nearly all stores in the United States have restricted hours on Sundays (most often 11 am or noon to 5 - 7 pm), and stores close early on important holidays, such as Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, and Independence Day. Banks, post offices and other government offices either are closed on weekends, or close early on Saturdays. Many other non-retail establishments remain closed on weekends.
In Islamic countries shops may have special opening hours during Ramadan.
In Israel, many shops are closed on religious holidays other than Shabbat, especially on Yom Kippur when nearly all businesses are closed.

By country
Australia
Shop trading hours in Australia are regulated by individual states and territories.
The Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania,  totally or almost totally deregulate shopping hours. All retail businesses in the two territories, regardless of size or product offer, are allowed to decide their trading hours to suit their individual customer demand. Non-essential shops in the three states are required to remain closed on Christmas Day and Good Friday, ANZAC Day (until 1 pm), and in Tasmania and NSW on Easter Sunday, and in NSW on Boxing Day (outside the Sydney special trading precinct). Shops in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory can remain open on any public holiday. The two main supermarket operators, Woolworths and Coles, generally trade between 6 am and midnight every day, although some inner-city shops in Sydney and Melbourne operate twenty-four hours. In Canberra, stores such as Woolworths  Kmart and Coles were open 24/7; however during the Covid-19 pandemic store closures, these stores did not reopen with 24/7 shopping hours.
Melbourne generally has the most relaxed rules. Almost all shopping centres in Melbourne now trade until 9 pm on Thursdays and Fridays as well as being open longer hours on Sundays. Interstate late night trading only occurs on either Thursday or Friday rather than both.
Melbourne is also famous for beginning the trend of 36-hour overnight trades in the lead-up to Christmas. Some of the larger shopping centres will open from 8 am December 23 until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Centres often open to 10 pm or midnight on most other nights in the fortnight before Christmas, and the first few days of the annual Boxing Day Sales.
Trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory have been deregulated since the repeal of the Trading Hours Act 1996 [ACT] on 29 May 1997.
Shopping hours in South Australia are still regulated, but there have been numerous changes to relax the laws. Nonetheless, trading laws are still face complicated and confusing: legal trading hours vary depending on size and product offer. Supermarkets that trade with fewer than seven workers and with a trading floor less than 500 m2 are exempt from the laws. Larger supermarkets are required by law to close at 9 pm on Mondays to Fridays, and 5 pm on Saturdays; they are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 9 am to 5 pm, except ANZAC Day, which is 12 noon to 5 pm; they must remain closed on Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.
In all areas of Queensland, trading hours of major supermarkets are Monday to Saturday from 7 am to 9 pm and Sundays and public holidays from 9 am to 6 pm. Most major shopping centres close at 5 pm every day, except for ""late night shopping"" on one night a week. Supermarkets in major shopping centres must still cease trading at 9 pm, with special access for just the supermarket.
In rural areas of Western Australia below the 27th parallel, local governments nominate shop closing hours to the State government, which, if accepted, are implemented by ministerial order. Shopping hours in the state's capital, Perth, are regulated by laws similar to South Australia's. Trading hours are stipulated in law, and are based on size and product offer. As in South Australia, smaller, independently operated supermarket retailers are exempted. Chain supermarkets are required to close Monday to Friday at 9 pm, Saturdays at 5 pm, and are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11 am to 5 pm.

Austria
The situation in Austria is very similar to that in Germany, with most public holidays being based on Catholic holidays as the country is predominantly Roman Catholic. Until the 1990s, all shops closed around noon on Saturday and did not reopen until Monday morning. Entrepreneurs such as Richard Lugner lobbied for an expansion of shopping hours, and laws are gradually being changed, with more and more exceptions granted. Meanwhile, as in Germany, filling stations and train stations in big cities have taken on the role of Nahversorger (""local providers"", supplying the local population with groceries) outside regular shopping hours.
Until very recently, shopping hours remained very restrictive. In 2008 Austria modified its 2003 Öffnungszeitengesetz (""opening times law""). The new regulations allow stores to open from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturday until 6:00 p.m. but they are restricted to a total of 72 open hours per week. Bakeries can open 30 minutes earlier at 5:30 a.m. Shops are closed on Sunday, but there are exceptions for tourist locations, train stations, airports, and the Christmas season.

Canada
Store hours in Canada are regulated by each province or territory and, in some provinces, individual municipalities as well.
As a general rule, there is little regulation of shopping hours across the country. In the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, as well as all three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), there are no restrictions at all and stores can open 24/7 every day. Nova Scotia permits any store to open every day of the year except Remembrance Day (November 11).
The remaining provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) require stores to close on most major holidays. Furthermore, three provinces have further restrictions on Sunday openings. In Manitoba, stores may open on Sundays only with municipal approval and only between 9 am - 6 pm (although exceptions for essential services apply). New Brunswick allows Sunday opening all year only with both municipal and provincial approval; otherwise it is permitted only from August until the New Year. Some communities in New Brunswick (such as Woodstock, Miramichi, Sussex) restrict Sunday hours of operation to 12 pm - 5 pm.
The province of Quebec is the only province in Canada that regulates shopping hours outside of Sundays and holidays. As a general rule, stores are permitted to open only between 8 am and 9 pm weekdays and 8 am - 5 pm weekends, excluding holidays. There are several exceptions, however, notably several supermarkets in Montreal, which are open later hours or 24 hours a day.
In practice, few stores in Canada (except a few grocery stores) remain open 24 hours. Most shopping centres open from 10 am-9pm Monday to Friday, 9:30 am - 6 pm (or in some cases 9 pm) on Saturday and 12 pm - 5 pm or 6 pm on Sunday. Many larger stores, such as Walmart Canada, and most major grocery stores remain open 8 am - 10 pm Monday to Saturday and 10 am - 6 pm (in some provinces 8 am - 10 pm) on Sunday, except in provinces where further restrictions apply. The Sobeys chain stays open from 7 am - 11 pm on weekdays and Saturdays, though some locations are open twenty-four hours. Many Loblaws brand stores such as Zehrs Markets and Real Canadian Superstore are open from 7 am - 11 pm, 7 days a week.

China
Trading hours in China, including Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions, are commercial decisions and are not regulated. Most shops are open on public holidays. Some convenience stores are open twenty-four hours and every day of the year, but only a few large supermarkets are open twenty-four hours a day.
During the Chinese New Year, many shops in China close for a few days, from Chinese New Year's Eve to the first day of the Chinese New Year. Or more often, to the third day of the Chinese New Year. Some shops in Hong Kong and Macau operate on Chinese New Year holidays, especially supermarket chains.

Croatia
Shopping hours in Croatia are currently unregulated after the Constitutional Court struck down a ban on Sunday shopping, which had been in effect from mid-2008 until mid-2009.
Most large out-of-town supermarkets are open between 07:30/08:00-21:00/22:00, Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls usually open at 09:00 and also close at 22:00, every day. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, typically at 13:00. Other shops in urban areas are generally closed on Sundays.
Bakeries and newspaper kiosks often open very early in the morning, at 05:30 or 06:00, and open every day but not twenty-four hours. Filling stations and convenience stores along major roads as well as some pharmacies (at least one in each major city, five in Zagreb) operate twenty-four hours.

Denmark
Standard operating hours for most businesses are generally 8:00/8:30 - 17:30. Since 1 October 2012, Danish shops have been allowed to be open every day around the clock, except on public holidays and after 3 pm on Christmas Eve's Day and New Year Eve's Day. Shops with a turnover of less than DKK 32.2 million (2012 figure, indexed) are allowed to be open every day of the year. Still in many small towns shops are usually closed on Saturday after 2 pm and on Sunday. Some small shops are closed on Monday.

Finland
Sunday shopping was first introduced in 1994.
In 1989 shops were allowed to be open on Sundays in sparsely populated areas. In the autumn of 1994 the law was extended to apply to the conurbanations i.e. densely populated areas, but only in December and on six specifically designated Sundays.
In 1997 it was legislated that the grocery shops could be open on Sundays during the whole summer. At the same time the closing hour was set at later; 21:00.
In 2000 small markets — less than 400 m2 in sales area —  were encouraged to be open on Sundays all year around, with the exception of four days. Also the legislation concerning (super)markets bigger than 400 m2 in sales area was clarified by discarding the law of six designated Sundays and replacing it with Sunday opening hours from May to August and from November to December.
On 15 December 2015, the Finnish parliament voted to remove all opening hour restrictions for all retailers. The law came into effect on 1 January 2016.
Many stores are open every day. Larger supermarkets and hypermarkets are open from 7:00 or 8:00 to 21:00 or 22:00, and smaller shops from 10:00 to 18:00 or 19:00.
The only stores with regulated hours are the nationally owned Alko alcohol shops, which are open from 9:00 to 21:00 on weekdays and from 9:00 to 18:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays all Alko stores are closed.
The sale of alcoholic beverages of over 2.8% is limited from 9:00 to 21:00 on each day of the week.

Germany
In Germany, shopping days and opening hours were previously regulated by a federal law called the ""Shop Closing Law"" (Ladenschlussgesetz), first enacted in 1956 and last revised on 13 March 2003. On 7 July 2006, however, the federal government handed over the authority to regulate shopping hours to the sixteen states (Länder). Since then, states have been allowed to pass their own laws regulating opening hours.
The federal Ladenschlussgesetz still applies in Bavaria and Saarland, which have not passed their own laws. Under this law, shops may not open prior to 6 am and may not stay open later than 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday. Shops must also stay closed on Sundays and public holidays (both federal and state), and special rules apply concerning Christmas Eve (December 24) should that day fall on a weekday.
There are several exceptions, including petrol stations and shops located in railway stations and airports, which may stay open past the normal hours. Most petrol stations in larger cities, and all situated on Autobahns, are open twenty-four hours. Shops in so-called ""tourist zones"" may also open outside the normal hours, but they are restricted to selling souvenirs, handcrafted articles and similar tourist items. In connection with fairs and public market days, communities are allowed four days per year (normally Sundays) on which shops may open outside the normal restrictions; such shop openings may not take place during primary church services and they must close by 6 pm. Bakeries may open for business at 5.30 am and may also open for a limited time on Sundays. Restaurants, bars, theatres, and cultural establishments are generally unaffected by the shop opening time restrictions. As most public holidays in Germany are religiously based, and since the religious holidays (Protestant and Catholic) are not uniform across Germany, shops may be closed due to a public holiday in one state, and open in a neighbouring state. Bavaria even differentiates between cities with Protestant or Catholic majorities.
The Ladenschlussgesetz has been the subject of controversy, as larger stores (and many of their customers) would prefer to have fewer restrictions on shopping hours, while trade unions, small shop owners and the church are opposed to a further loosening of the rules. On June 9, 2004, the German supreme court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) rejected a claim by the German department store chain Kaufhof AG that the shop-closing law was unconstitutional. Among other things, the court cited Article 140 of the German constitution (Grundgesetz) (which in turn invokes Article 139 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution) protecting Sundays and public holidays as days of rest and recuperation. Nonetheless, the court in effect invited the federal parliament (Bundestag) to reconsider whether the states should regulate hours instead of the federal government.
So far, no state has passed a regulation that allows general store opening on Sundays.

Ireland
Shops in Ireland may, with few exceptions (such as those involved in the sale of alcohol), open whenever they want, including Sundays and public holidays.
Here are typical hours:

Monday - Wednesday, Saturday: 8:00/9:00/10:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00
Thursday - Friday: 8:00/9:00/10:00 - 20:00/21:00/22:00
Sunday: 9:00/10:00/11:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00
Many supermarkets are open twenty-four hours or have longer opening hours (like 8:00 - 22:00) every day.
Large shopping centres are typically open longer hours every day (e.g. 09:00 - 21:00/22:00 weekdays, 09:00 - 19:00 Saturdays, 10:00 - 19:00 Sundays).
In the two weeks running up to Christmas, it is common for many shops to have extended opening hours; some may operate twenty-four hours however the 24 hr openings are extremely uncommon and would be mainly in the large cities. On Christmas Eve most shops have shut their doors by 6 pm, some close by 3 pm.
Most shops (other than petrol stations or convenience stores) in smaller towns and villages don't open at all on Sundays. Almost all shops (except certain petrol stations, convenience stores) are closed on Christmas Day, though most are open on all other holidays.
Convenience stores and some chemists (drugstores) normally open at 09:00 and close between 18:00 and 21:00. New Year's Day is also Sunday hours.
In rural areas or in traditional trades, Businesses used to take a half day on Wednesdays, however this no longer happens.
Alcohol is allowed to be sold only between 10:30 and 22:00 from Monday to Saturday and 12:30 to 22:00 on Sundays, but this does not affect opening hours (supermarkets will often block access to alcoholic products outside of these times). Alcohol can now  be sold on Good Friday as-well as having the pubs open.

Japan
In Japan, most shops open at 10:00, and close at 20:00 (8 pm). Banks are open from 09:00-15:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends; post offices are open from 09:00-17:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends. Convenience stores are open round the clock.

Mexico
In Mexico City, in large shopping centers, stores are generally open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., and on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Restaurant and cinema hours are different, as are those of independent shops and markets.

Netherlands
Regular opening hours are Monday 11:00 - 18:00; Tuesday-Friday: 09:30 - 18:00; Saturday: 09:30 - 17:00; Sunday (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Almere, Leiden and smaller tourist towns): 12:00 - 18:00. In many other towns shops are open every first Sunday of the month (koopzondag).

Shops are allowed to stay open until 22:00 from Monday to Saturday. Except in busy tourist areas, in or near railway stations, or for big box retailers such as Media Markt, most close at 18:00 on weekdays, and 17:00 on Saturdays, unlike Germany where retailers have taken fuller advantage of liberalization laws and most stay open till at least 19:30. Many supermarkets (including outlets of the market leader Albert Heijn, several DIY stores and IKEA) stay open until 20:00, 21:00 or 22:00. Most towns have their weekly shopping evening (koopavond), when shops stay open until 21:00, on Thursday or Friday. In touristic towns (like Amsterdam's city centre) supermarkets are allowed to open on Sundays between 07:00 and 22:00. Many towns have one or more supermarkets (avondwinkels) that are open until later in the evening, occasionally all night. Convenience stores also have longer shopping hours; they are at many larger railway stations (""Albert Heijn to go"") and in some busy streets.
A regular size supermarket that is open until midnight seven days a week is the Albert Heijn at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam (in the landside area of the airport, not just for air travelers).
On public holidays, shops that close on Sundays are usually also closed, and other shops tend to have Sunday opening hours. On Christmas Day and New Year's Eve almost all shops are closed.
For specific opening hours (openingstijden) in the Netherlands there are several websites.

Serbia
Shopping hours in Serbia are unregulated. Large supermarkets are usually open from 07:00/07:30/08:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls open at 09:00 or 10:00 and also stay open until 22:00. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, at 15:00 or 16:00.
Unlike neighbouring Croatia, many fast food outlets, bakeries, kiosks and convenience stores in urban areas operate twenty-four hours. Even some hypermarkets, like Tempo and Metro, are open twenty-four hours.

Singapore
Shopping hours for shopping malls are usually from 10:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Automotive shops like tire outlets are usually from 09.30 to 19:00. Some supermarkets are open twenty-four hours. Most stores do not open on the first day of Chinese New Year because of low demand patronage.

Sweden
In Sweden there is no longer any law regarding shopping hours except for the nationally owned Systembolaget alcohol shops, which close at 20:00 at the latest on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays no alcohol is sold at all, although it is served in restaurants. Shopping centres and food shops are generally open every day; grocery stores often until 22:00 all days of the week and shopping centers usually until 20:00 on weekdays and 18:00 on weekends. Usually shopping centers are closed on New Year's Day, Midsummer's Day and Christmas Day, but grocery stores are open even those days albeit fewer hours than usual. Although there aren't any law that regulate business hours in general, labour laws do not allow work between midnight and 5 am in many professions including grocery stores and most shops.

Switzerland
Shopping hours are governed by cantonal law and vary accordingly, the only confederally mandated store holiday being August 1 (the national holiday), as per article 110 III of the Swiss Constitution. Most often, stores will be open from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, 9 pm one day a week (usually a Thursday or a Friday) depending on the region. On Saturday and the day before public holidays, most stores close at around 4 or 5 pm. Stores are also generally closed on Sundays; see Sunday shopping in Switzerland.

United Kingdom
In Great Britain, many retail stores are open every day. Some large supermarkets are open for twenty-four hours, (except on Sundays in England and Wales). Most stores do not open on Easter Sunday, New Year's Day or Christmas Day and have reduced hours on other public and bank holidays.
Typical store shopping hours:

Mondays - Saturdays: 9:00 am to 5:30 pm, or 10:00 am to 8:00 pm/10:00 pm.
Sundays: 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, or 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, or 12 noon to 6:00 pm.
Sunday shopping has become more popular, and most but not all shops in towns and cities are open for business. Shops 280 m2 and larger in England and Wales are allowed to trade for only six hours on Sundays; shops in Northern Ireland may open from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In Scotland, in theory, Sunday is considered the same as any other day, and there are no restrictions. In practice, however, some shops do not open on Sunday or open for only four hours in smaller towns. In some Free Church dominated areas, for example Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Sunday is considered a day of rest and consequently very few if any shops open at all.

United States
In the United States, the various levels of government generally do not regulate the hours of the vast majority of retailers (though there are exceptions, such as the blue law), and with the main exception being shops licensed to sell spirits and other alcoholic beverages (for shopping hours, see alcohol sale hours by state) and car dealerships. Shopping hours vary widely based on management considerations and customer needs. Key variables are the size of the metropolitan area, the type of store, and the size of the store.
Las Vegas, Nevada is the notable exception to all the traditions just described. Las Vegas is world-famous for its 24-hour local culture since it is an area with large gaming and tourism industries that operate 24/7. Since many of the employees in the city's primary industries work overnight shifts — and because Nevada has few laws in regard to operating hours for any type of commercial activity — many businesses cater to such workers. Thus, Las Vegas is home to many 24-hour car dealerships, dental clinics, auto mechanics, computer shops, and even some smaller clothing stores.
Typical store shopping hours:

Monday - Saturday 9 - 10 a.m. to 8 - 10 p.m. (9:00 - 10:00 to 20:00 - 22:00)
Sunday 11 - 12 noon to 5 - 7 p.m. (11:00 - 12:00 to 17:00 - 19:00)
Supermarkets usually open at earlier hours, between 6 or 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (7:00 - 22:00) every day.  Boutiques and smaller shops often close early at 5 or 6 p.m. (17:00 or 18:00), and usually close once or twice a week, most often on Sunday.
Nearly all stores are closed on Easter, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In recent years, however, several department stores and discount stores have started opening during the evening on Thanksgiving Day; see Black Friday for more details. Early closing (half days) occur on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. Some stores might have reduced hours on other major holidays.
All malls and department stores, as well as most other stores remain open longer hours between Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas Eve for Christmas and holiday shopping. Many are open until 11 p.m. (23:00), and a few even longer.
Few stores remain open twenty-four hours; the main exceptions to this rule are most Walmarts throughout the country (especially Supercenters, which combine a discount store and full supermarket); many convenience stores, especially those that also sell motor fuel; and some drug stores like CVS, especially in larger cities like New York City and Las Vegas.
Some stores, especially in suburban and rural areas, might remain closed on Sundays for any reason (such as most retail in Bergen County, New Jersey due to the blue law, which is next to New York City, and home to four major malls and has the largest retail in the nation).
